I don't like leaving bad reviews, but this place is getting one. 

I'd see this place along Chandler Blvd, I was told by a coworker it was her "favorite place to go - best Mexican she ever had". She may have been an idiot and I may have had high expectations, but I expected SOMETHING edible. 

The chips & salsa were mediocre at  best, probably not even that. 

Beer was ok I guess - got a pitcher. 

But the food was horrendous. 

The tasteless things my wife got were just a joke - NOTHING seemed to have much flavor or quality. 

Our server was relatively hapless.. I'd NEVER go back. 

Even Arriba further down Chandler Blvd is much better than this. 

Skip it.
