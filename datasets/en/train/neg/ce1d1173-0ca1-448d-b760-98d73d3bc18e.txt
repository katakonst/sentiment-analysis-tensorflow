last time we ate at this "establishment" a cock roach crawled across the bar.  When we told the owner we were told that a shipment of produce was infected by roaches. No offer to refund the meal was offered. We delivered an email of disapproval to the owner upon which she responded with refunding the meal.

today when we returned for the first time since that unfortunate incident the owner informed us we were no longer welcome in her establishment. 

It seems a roach infestation had lowered her Maricopa Health department score - which somehow was our fault for indicating to her that there was a problem.

very disappointing.  This is a restaurant i've enjoyed for years and years but will never dine at again.
