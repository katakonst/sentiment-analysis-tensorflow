Just bought porkchops meat on 5.29.20011 and on 5/30/2011 when I opened the package it was RANCID!!!!!!!
Took back to the store on 5/31/2011 and the lady was non apoligetic and refused to return my money when the meat was clearly marked with best use date and walmart wrappers. She would only offer me a gift card.
NEVER A "I'M SORRY"...NOTHING. I will never shop here or any walmart again for meat!!!!!
It was GROSS!!!!!
