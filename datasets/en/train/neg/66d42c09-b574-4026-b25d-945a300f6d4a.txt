The day manager there is extremely rude. He's in his 30s n thinks he's badass for being a manager. 

I was waiting in line for a prescription. An older lady 60-70 yrs old had a raincheck for cereal. He begins to degrade her bc she had the store copy of the raincheck. He trained everybody in this store and they wouldn't have given her the copy. I couldn't believe he would think she was trying to pull a scam for 2 boxes of cereal. The lady never said a word. I still regret not saying something about how rude he was. 

Pharmacy is always slow and when u need an OTC med they ignore you and are rude bc they have to get ur drivers license info.
