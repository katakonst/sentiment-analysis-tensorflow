Quite disappointed. It was the only one open on Mondays though. I was searching for something as good as the food in LA, but no luck. Food was cold, expensive, servings were small. What they had on the menu wasn't there such as pancit. They said they stop making it at 4:30 pm and the place closes at 8:30 pm...wow. Never again, no matter how Bad the craving. 

Any suggestions for other Filipino restaurants worth eating in Chandler???
