$10 for a beer!?!  Seriously?  They should be ashamed.  And I thought $6 for a bottle of Bud Light at The Marquee was ridiculous

Here's some math for you, A-hole Airways Center . . . at Chase Field during a D'backs game a couple weeks ago I had eight $4 beers totaling $32.  At the Rush show at your venue tonight, because of your insane pricing, I had zero $10 beers totaling $0.

Don't spend that $0.00 all in one place, douche bags
