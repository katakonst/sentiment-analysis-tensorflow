I hate this place and I don't like to use the word "hate". It's a crime what they charge for pizza in comparison to what you get, it's awful and they should be ashamed to serve it. Many of the games were not working, the place was disgustingly dirty and the staff all seemed like they hated the place as much as I do. Whenever one of my kids gets invited to a birthday party at Chuck E Cheese's I cringe, I'd rather shoot myself in the foot with a .22 than go back to this rip-off...
