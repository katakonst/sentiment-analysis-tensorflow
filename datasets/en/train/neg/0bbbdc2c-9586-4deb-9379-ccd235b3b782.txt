Wow first one star.

This rating is for the service, not the food.  According to James Blake, Subway tastes the same in Shanghai, New York and London.

Although most people dont like their jobs, the ladies that work at this particular location really really hate theirs. The sandwiches are sloppy, little to no eye contact, and not one single smile. I'm not saying I want Mrs Personality making my food, but if I wanted to order through a robot I would have gone to Arbys (some of them now have automated ordering machines, they look like ATM's and you can customize your orders, pay, and just wait for your number to be called) 

And something else. The stupid 5 dollar foot long song. Seriously, I HATE IT!
