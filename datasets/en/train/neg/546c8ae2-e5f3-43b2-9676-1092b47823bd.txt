The worst steak I've ever had. I had a $75 Kobe beef steak that had a stick of butter melted over the top. WTF!? What kind of restaraunt would do that to a steak? 

I also burned my hand on the steak plate that comes from the oven. I'm all for a hot plate, but giving a customer a plate capable of a 3rd degree burn, is that really necessary?!
