Ordered the 2 chicken soft tacos.....so bland and dry I poured salsa all over to help but even then it wasn't so palatable. I probably ate half of one of them. The Mexican rice was gross..how do you manage that?! And the black beans were so salty. 
The outside of the restaurant fools you...it looks nice but inside you get really bad food. 
Drinks are soooo expensive. I ordered a $12 margarita which was good but I can't imagine any margarita being worth that. Wish I'd checked yelp before coming here...wish I'd gone to Pizza Hut instead....
Total price of bad pod and overpriced drink and decent service for one is $28. Makes me sick this "restaurant" is in business!
