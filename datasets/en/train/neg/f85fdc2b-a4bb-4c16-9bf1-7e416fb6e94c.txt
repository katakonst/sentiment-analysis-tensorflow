My husband and I took his mother out for her birthday lunch and our first impression was not good. Because it never dawned on us that we could just turn around and walk right out, we proceeded on to the buffet. To put it bluntly, it was gross. 

It was the smallest, greasiest Chinese Buffet we had ever seen.....and it was equally confusing to us because we thought we were at a Thai restaurant!!!

No one in our party enjoyed the food. My husband powered down his one and only plate, my mother-in-law politely ate all her food but enjoyed little, and I sat back and enjoyed my Thai Iced Tea and waited for it all to be over. The worst $30 I have ever spent.

I will never return.
