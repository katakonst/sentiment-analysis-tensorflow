Pho-yuck this place! 

I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house. 

The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease. 

The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease. 

I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.

The service was horrible and I will not be back.
