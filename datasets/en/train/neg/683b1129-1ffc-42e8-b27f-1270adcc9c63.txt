My grandmothers weren't this rude and their cooking was INFINITELY better-tasting.  Don't waste the trip.  I ordered eggs that had absolutely no taste to them.  The waitress went out of her way to be rude to me and other guests there.  

HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service (I think they are mentally ill) and very bad food.
