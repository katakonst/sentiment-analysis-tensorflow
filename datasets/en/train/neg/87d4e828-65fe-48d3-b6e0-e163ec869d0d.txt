The food is OK, but over-priced for the atmosphere.  The decor --or lack thereof-- is a bit too casual for my taste.  Do I really need to see produce stacked under prep tables?  The service, although attentive, is way too casual for this senior citizen.  

I definitely do not care for a restaurant whose staff wears white T-shirts and jeans or khakis, thrusting full-sleeve tattoos in my face as they reach across the table.  I suppose it's a generation thing, but anyone under 50 who goes here should be fore-warned.
