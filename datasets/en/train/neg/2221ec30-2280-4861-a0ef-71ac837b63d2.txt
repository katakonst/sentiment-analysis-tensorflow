TRASH. TRASH. TRASH.
This bar is a complete waste of time. The only time I will go there now is if a friend is playing there. Every time I have gone it is like our generations excuse to be completely uninhibited, disgusting and irresponsible. Not to mention if you want a free show of someone blowing someone else, screwing, fighting or snorting things this is THE place to be.
