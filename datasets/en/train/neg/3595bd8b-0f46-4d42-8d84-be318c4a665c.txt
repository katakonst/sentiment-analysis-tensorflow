I am going to jump on the "this bar sucks" bandwagon. I am not fond of the bar, the staff or the cliental. My experience was a crowded bar where I had to push myself up against every Tom, Dick and Hairy just to make my way through the crowd. I even got my butt grabbed by some random guy and when I turned around to shoot him a dirty look he said, " pass that on to your friend with the nice ass." Thanks- real boost for the self esteem buddy.

Anyways- don't go there unless your desperate.
