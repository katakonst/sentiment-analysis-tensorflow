No!

I would stay clear from any product that comes out of a factory that would allow product with INSECTS in it to be sold to innocent people...and children! There was a leg of some insect in mine. I did not eat the rest.

It's not just the insects (like that wouldn't be the one thing to scare you away) but it's the freaking quality. Now, I've had some from Coffee Plantation at Westgate and man oh man...that stuff is AMAZING!
It's smooth and rich and NOT GRAINY OR WATERY like you-know-who's.
It tastes like the real deal in Italy.
OUTSTANDING is how I would rate that gelato. 
Angelo's will never be one of my choices again. EVER!

P.S. The Food City next door has rats in it. I wouldn't trust the buildings next to it.  No rodent droppings for me please.
