Do NOT go here!  It used to be Taste of India or something like that.  I went out of my way on a weekly basis to go there.  Until just last weekend.  Ugh.  The pakoori were plain old fried veggies.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had chunks of...something white.  The chicken itself seemed ok (how can you screw up tandoori???) but I will never, EVER go there agin!
