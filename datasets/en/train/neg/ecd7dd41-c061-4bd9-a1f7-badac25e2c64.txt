Save yourself from unnecesary restaurant pain and go somewhere else for real Mexican food.  I usually don't do restaurant bashing but sometimes it's just a guys civic duty.  This place is like somebody in Switzerland's idea of a real southwest Mexican restaurant.  The place is cavernous with decour ala Taiwan import company.  The food is bland and you could probably find more authenticity eating Stouffers.  Margarita's are overpriced but OK.  How can you screw up a margarita?  Besides that it's a great place for another restaurant.
