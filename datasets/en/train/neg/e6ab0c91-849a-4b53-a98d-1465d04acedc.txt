We got some for a work birthday, so I haven't been IN the building, but I shared 2 cupcakes (each person eats 1total but tries 2 halves...) chocolate and Bourbon Vanilla and I have to say that I would have had a better overall cupcake with Duncan Hines.  The cake was dry.  The frosting wasn't more than ok with hints of good.  The chocolate was so thick it was like a dessert on it's own, but then it left a heavy oily aftertaste.  Not like "oh they used real butter" oily just like.... "fat" oily.  Blech.  

I have given very very very few 1 stars in my time, and I might have been tempted to go to 2 stars until I remembered the price.  Taste = 1.5 stars.  Taste to value = 1 star.
