So we hobbled over here in our high heels (car hunting wasn't on the days agenda) from Ferrari to find some Cayenne's they had advertised on-line.  At least the salesman got up out of his chair but had no clue where any of the cars were.  I've never heard "aint" "wanna" and "dunno" so many times in one conversation, let alone from a Lotus salesman.  On the upside, they sell Fisker's here too.  Come in for a little eye candy.
