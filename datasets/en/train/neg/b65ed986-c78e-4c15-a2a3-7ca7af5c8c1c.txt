Being in this bar makes me feel dirty. There are always the creepiest of the creepy guys inside and the girls that look like their fake IDs weren't good enough to get them into a good bar on Mill. The music is always insanely loud (and not even good, usually). 

Highlight: the outdoor patio. I'm a sucker for outdoor dining/drinking
