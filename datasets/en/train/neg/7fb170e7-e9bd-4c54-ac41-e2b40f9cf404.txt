one Word....EEEEWWWW!!!!

This place is like a nursing home cafeteria. The Food and the customers!

Being called a pancake house I thought that the pancakes would be good....instead I got old dry crumbly and cold cakes...... my omelet was more of a scramble and the eggs were browned and slimy... is that even possible?UGH!

I'll NEVER eat there again!! 

If there was a choice for no stars they'd be getting that.

And all I can say is anyone who thinks this place is great needs to quit drinking!
