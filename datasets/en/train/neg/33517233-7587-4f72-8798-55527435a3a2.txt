I am actually still in line for Spiderman. Finished off my large Coke and went for a refill, the guy looked at me like I was stupid. THEY DO NOT OFFER REFILLS.

This is obviously some sort of communist plot and I for one will not let this injustice stand. I used to enjoy Cinemark, but as of the end of this movie, I am back to Harkins.
