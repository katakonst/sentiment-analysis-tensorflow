Shame on you Macaroni Grill! I ordered a "Create Your Own Pasta" dish for take out and was horrified when I got home. My $14 pasta (which included chicken for an extra $3.50) consisted of one small chunk of chicken the size of a nickel and approx. 15 noodles. There was virtually no sign of the sauce or veggies I had requested. What a horrible waste of money.
