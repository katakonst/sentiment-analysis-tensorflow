This place was dirty and gross. They didn't have a menu. It is volunteer run which is pretty cool, but not if it takes 25 minutes to get a lemonade and not if you are watching the volunteers screaming at each other and throwing stuff at each other. The food was bland and not worth eating. Didn't get the impression that any of the food was organic, and the place was very very very dirty. 
Saw a kid in his diaper running around the kitchen area. Weird. 

Overall it's a good concept, but seriously I like to feel clean when I eat out and feel like I don't have to wait a half hour for a lemonade when it is 110 degrees outside. 

Peace.
