This was the most HORRIBLE experience I have ever had in any establishment, retail or otherwise! I will never ever, ever, ever go there again. Not only was the owner horribly rude she was also a horrible cheat. She was hired to do a few repairs and gave me a quote. When I went to pick up the work ( they never called me to tell me that anything was finished) she tells me that the most expensive piece could not be done, then gives me the SAME amount due for the other pieces. I confront her and she refuses to not scam me. She covered the original receipt (I lost mine) and refuses to let me see it. They are horrible horrible lying cheats and I urge no one to use their business!!!
