-Conveniently located next to Trader Joe's.

-Purchase food or janatorial items in bulk...like a teeny fraction size of Costco.

-Clean store.

-Service...not so great. :( 

-Each time I have stopped in here, there is one cashier and 4-5+ customers in line (like Hobby Lobby).

-Most prices are not so reasonable to lure me back.

-Observed two employees chatting in the aisle, instead of opening another register to expedite customer check-out.

-After deciding NOT to wait in the long one-cashier line, I left my "potential purchases" near the register. Instead of opening another register to assist with checking out customers, another employee wasted no time scooping up my abondoned items.

-I'm surprised that this business is still open. You get a vibe that the employees hate their job and that management is terrible.
