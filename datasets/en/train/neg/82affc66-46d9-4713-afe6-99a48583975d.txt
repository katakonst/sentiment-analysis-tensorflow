I ordered a dozen garlic Parmesan wings and a order of fried zucchini. Although they weren't the worst wings I've had, they definitely were no where close to being the best. The wings were cold, probably due to the gallon of wet sauce they were covered in. The zucchini was burnt. I was skeptical pulling into the parking lot because it looked like a carnival. Let me just say it looked the same way inside. The dining room was covered in carnival toys and looked like they haven't dusted in years. They had hand made menus all over the place. We also had a homeless visitor come in to our table and ask for money so he could eat. One word for this place YUK!
