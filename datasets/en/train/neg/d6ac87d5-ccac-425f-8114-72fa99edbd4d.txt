The worst service in all of Chandler.i have been here a dozen times and it never improves. Takes 10 minutes to get a menu and silverware. Another 10 minutes to place an order and then 30 minute to make an egg. I am a person who enjoys supporting non-big chain local small business but not at the sacrafice of poor service. The village in is only 2 miles west of the hanger cafe on queen creek.
