WARNING - THIS IS THE MOST DISHONEST CAR REPAIR SHOP EVER! They do not deserve any stars at all.  I was there in 2008 fixing an A/C problem.  According to the repair guy, I needed a new A/C hose, which cost over $500 to fix the problem.  In less than a year, my A/C was out and blowing hot air out again!  I do not know exactly what was fixed, probably nothing at all.  After seeing the reviews on Yelp, I must write my review to warn everyone.
