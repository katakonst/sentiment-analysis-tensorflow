I don't know what everyone loves about this place.  We ate there today and tried many of the items they are known for - onion rings had no flavor what-so-ever, the barbeque chicken pizza was not good at all, I had to actually douse it with barbeque sauce to even make it have a modicum of flavor, the kids corn dogs were just like you would buy at the grocery store and my husbands double dogs tasted like the chili was burnt to a crisp.  All in all at 38.00 total this was a horrible experience.  We will not be eating here again that is for sure!
