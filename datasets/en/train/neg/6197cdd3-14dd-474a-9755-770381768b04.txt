I went to Ideal Image in 2010.

They wouldn't take my money directly, forced me to sign up to a third-party company "CareCredit." I tried to set up monthly automatic payment with this company and they kept charging me $39 late fees. (Late fees on automatic payment?) Needless to say this company was not reputable and Ideal Image didn't do their research before partnering with them.

After that experience, I went to Laser for Less in Scottsdale. They charge $100 for an area when Ideal Image charges $350 (Prices: Legs/Per session). Quality is the same (6-8 sessions), for a fraction of the price.Trust me, this place is overpriced crazytown.
