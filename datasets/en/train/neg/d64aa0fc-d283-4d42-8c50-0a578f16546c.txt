Sorry, but I was really disappointed in this place.   I love Vietnamese food and eat it as often as I can.  I also love a good dive restaurant too, so I was excited when I heard about this place.  My husband and I both ordered the pho and the spring rolls.  The pho broth was okay, but the sprouts and herbs to accompany were VERY old and withered.  They looked to be about a week old or so.  It was very unappetizing.  I did mention it to the server and she kind of shrugged her shoulders and walked away.  Fresh ingredients are a must in Vietnamese cooking.  Maybe it was a fluke, but I don't think we'll go back.
