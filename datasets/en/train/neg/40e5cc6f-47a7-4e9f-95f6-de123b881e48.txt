ouch they went WAYYY down in my ratings,

service was horrible, it took 10 minutes to get seated and it wasn't busy and there were empty tables everywhere... server took 15 minutes to get us waters, server forgot what i ordered and didn't even remember my soup till prompted that my food should come with it. (20 minutes after everyone else got theirs)

food under cooked, they served some of the steak strip cooked black and blue style...

food served COLD, not hot, not warm..but.. COLD!! gross

wasabi is the crappy powder kind
