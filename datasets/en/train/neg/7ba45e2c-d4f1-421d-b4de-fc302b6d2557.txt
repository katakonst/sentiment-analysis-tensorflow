I can't stand this place.  I made 3 attempts to purchase (and to get educated) on a new mountain bike.  The sales staff were arrogant and completely useless.  I finally purchased a new bike from another store.  It's a shame as Landis is right by my house.  I will not even buy an inner tube from them.
