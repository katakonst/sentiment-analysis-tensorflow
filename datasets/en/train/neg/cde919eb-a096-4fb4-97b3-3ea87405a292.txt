Food was decent, but the wine service and specifically the know it all bait and switching snob of a somm will ensure I never return.

Went in anticipating a great dinner and a great bottle of wine, poured over the wine list with my partner and found several great bottles...that were all mysteriously out of stock.

You have a 200 page wine list that the server laughingly refers to as a 'novel' and somehow everything I picked is out of stock?

The somm came over and recommended a bottle I'd never heard of, but insisted it was similar to the things I'd picked.

It wasn't, I knew from the second the server popped the cheap composite cork.

When I got home I looked it up - a $12 bottle that they'd charged me $44 for. I hope the profit was worth it, I'll never be back.
