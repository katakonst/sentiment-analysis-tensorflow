HORRIBLE service. I have never once asked for napkins at a restaurant I was a paying customer of and been asked "what for?" as a response. Just give me a damn napkin!

The food was below average. The terrible service and multiple dirty looks from the workers is not worth going back to ever again. Next time I'm craving Hawaiian food, I'll make the drive to Aloha Kitchen in Mesa.
