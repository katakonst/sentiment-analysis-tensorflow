Sad...sad...sad....what happened, this place was once cool, I give it a few more months and it will be offices or ghostown, I think one the reasons people do not go there, paying for parking is just not cool anymore..it cost me $12 bucks..and when talked to the attendant just for an explanation...he acted like he just did not give a shit!! That will be my last time there, and as far as recommendations to friends and family...forget it!! Too quote a famous movie "Iceberg ahead!!"
