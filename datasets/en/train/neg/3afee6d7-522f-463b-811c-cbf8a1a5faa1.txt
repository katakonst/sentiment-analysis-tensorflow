Bad experience with a female dentist there. I had a bad tooth ache going in, coming home with an even worst pain on my infected tooth. 

The female doctor there is LAZY. She did a root canal for kids on me because it is a much easier procedure. I got charged "full price", $$$$$ for adult root canal.

Afterwards, she send me home without antibiotics nor pain meds on my infected tooth. It was so painful that the horrible pain kept me up all night.

I would not recommend her to anybody!
