Won't waste my time coming back here. With nobody around on a Sunday night, the 9:30pm showing of a movie nearly empty, we were refused tickets because I didn't have my ID to prove I was over 21. Really? I'm frickin' old enough to be your mother, kid. Was told we could see another movie on the forks side. For $30? No, thanks. AMC MAJOR FAIL! I'll just spend my money elsewhere.
