Maybe this is a bit unfair but we checked the website and called in before driving over here.  Both sources said that the venue was open at the time we were aiming to arrive at.  However, once we arrived the venue was dark and empty.  No signs or warning that they would be closed.

Would have appreciated a heads up before making the trip out there.
