Ugh! I just can't eat here anymore. I love Olive Garden, possibly more than the average person but on three different occasions in the past 12 months I found hair in my food!!! One time I told a waitress and she said it looked like mine! It was a short brown hair and I have long blondish-brown hair. I don't think so. 

I am so totally grossed out by this location. I will make the trek to Norterra or Old Town because a girl needs her soup and salad every now and then, just hold the hair please.
