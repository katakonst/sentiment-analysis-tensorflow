The store might HAVE BEEN great but it is history.  Why a business wouldn't update their website is beyond me.  Leaves me in serious doubt of just how "great" it / or their owners were.   

I drove 30 minutes to check out the great stuff and it is most certainly closed- didn't even have a sign up just a "space for lease" sign all over the front.  

SAVE YOUR TIME and don't go.  If I had called first, I could have saved myself the hour of wasted time and gas; their phone is also disconnected.
