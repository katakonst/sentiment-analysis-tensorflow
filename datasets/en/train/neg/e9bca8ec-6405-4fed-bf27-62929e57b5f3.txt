I was taking a tour of this complex, and I literally saw two mice run out of the bushes...not that big of a deal I guess, but that's just the beginning. I felt like I was on a used car lot, apparently they are desperate for people to move in, the person giving the tour kept trying to hard close me on signing that day. I overheard a couple arguing, and one of them threatened to kill the other...this place looks nice on the outside, but it's straight ghetto inside. Needless to say i did not sign a lease.
