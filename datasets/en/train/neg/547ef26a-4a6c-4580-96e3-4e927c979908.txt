********The noise level on Sunday, was unacceptable.**********

I defy you, to hear a single word, your table mate(s) say.
Not the place..... if you want conversation.......between bites.

YOU'LL revisit your youth on Sunday .... remember those Rock Concerts ??? 

*********My first time here on a Sunday .... and MY LAST !!! ***********

Monday thru Friday, you can hear yourself think.
Saturday, I have no idea.
Sunday, the noise ambiance is on the verge, of being pain-full.

The food was A-OK..... 4 stars
The service was also ..... 4 stars

THE ONE STAR IS FOR THE NOSIEST RESTAURANT, I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.
