Bunch of self entitled Scottsdale punks work out here. I come to work out and and not be threatened because I used a vacant machine that some roid head was using. I've never seen so many snotty, over cologned, immature kids  in a gym before. I've relocated several times in my life. Worked out all over Florida including W. Palm Beach. Overcrowded, music sucks, staff have no social skills and a sea of fake boobies. But I like boobs. 

Greenway Parkway Gym is awesome though. 

Tatum south of Cactus also good and not usually crowded.
