Very spacious area and quiet . That's the positive. For the price and because it is classified as a " resort" I expected a whole lot more for what I paid. $17 a day resort fee does not include wifi . When I asked what was included in resort fee answer was " parking , pool, and fitness center " . The actual room it self was dated and felt dingy. A holiday inn would  have probably been nicer . Save your money and stay and the Marriott up the street .
