I honestly am so disgusted with this place. The staff is unprofessional. 24 hour fitness is only maybe 10 dollars more a month with a better staff and better advisement of what you're actually signing a contract for. Won't let me cancel and I haven't used the gym once in the two weeks I've had the membership. Don't waste any money there.
