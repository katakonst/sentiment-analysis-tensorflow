Poor management, period!!  Last week at 5:15PM, Tuesday, July 10, 2012, we were there for some sandwiches.  Most of the Asian items were sold out.  Today July 15, 2012, we went back driving all the way from Peoria and arrived at 4:46PM, and the sign said, "Hot Baguette" yum!  We went inside ordered our combination sandwiches and some hot baguettes.  The cashier told us the all of the baguettes had sold out already but the hot baguette sign still left on.  This is false advertisement, people.  Also, the ingredients they put in the sandwiches are inconsistent, and it's franchise restaurant, seriously?
