Oh dear server, will you marry one of my friends?  He was way too charming, very helpful, and patient for someone who was *forced* to serve 8 high maintenance girls from So Cal.  

As far as the food goes, I'd rate this as a 5 for more of a cocktails/hor d'eurves  , and not so much a full dinner.  While there were large portions, it still has the vibe of a cocktail hour that happens before weddings, with more appetizer food.  

3 things you need to know:

-Split the bruchetta and maybe order an appetizer for u two.  $12-13
-My favorite was the smoked salmon bruschetta.  2nd favorite was the apple brie.
-Order the vanilla ice cream topped with salted caramel and...get this..chocolate covered cornuts.  Seriously..,heaven for us women who love the sweet/salty combination. $5.00
