If you're thinking...mmmm I'm craving Pei Wei, go here instead.  It's in the same plaza (this place was there first), you get larger portions, same price, but the food is just WAY better.  The owner is usually present, and is a great guy.  My favorite is the dandan noodles (blows Chang's version out of the water).  The sesame chicken is good, the appetizer sampler plate is more than enough food as well.  Honestly, I stopped going to Pei Wei after I found this place.
