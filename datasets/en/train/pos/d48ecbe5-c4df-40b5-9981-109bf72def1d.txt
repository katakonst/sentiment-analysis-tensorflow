SRP has been the BEST utility company that I have ever had to deal with.  The online tools that are offered are absolutely perfect!  You can have notifications sent to your phone that alert you of what your monthly SRP bill is averaging, tools that show you and explain the different plans and a great customer support phone line.  
I called and changed my plan from Basic to Time of Use Plan, which is saving me about $80.00 per month (summertime usage).  I was on the phone for maybe 4 minutes, and tool the phone survey.  I received a follow up phone call within minutes making sure that everything I needed was handled appropriately!  
I cant say enough about SRP!!
