I really dig this place.  Awesome decor, great mood lighting, really tasty menu, expansive wine list.  It's kind of an upscale take on mediterrenean food.  i had the chicken (which was perfectly juicy & tasty) with parmesan risotto & asparagus.  pretty good all the way around.  i'd definitely eat here again.
