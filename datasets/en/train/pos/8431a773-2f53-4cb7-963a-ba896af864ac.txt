I love weird food - combinations you woudn't ever think would go together but do, herb-flavored desserts, etc. Lavender is one of those flavors that a little too much and you feel like you're eating perfume. At Sweet Republic, they know this, because a spoonful of their lavender gelato proved exquisite. 

Their corn gelato, however, was all too packed with the familiar flavor of corn, which I now know beyond a shadow of a doubt, is not what I want in a dessert. But it was there, and for novelty's sake, I had to try it.

Too many gelaterias serve gelato that is hard and icy - essentially rendering them ice cream at a higher price. SR's gelato is smooth and creamy, as gelato should be. And with their penchant for unusual flavors, Sweet Republic is IMHO one of the best in the area.
