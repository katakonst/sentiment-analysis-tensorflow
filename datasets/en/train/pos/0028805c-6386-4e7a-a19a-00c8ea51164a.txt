VSC puts the ART in sandwiches!  They really do take their time prepping your sani for you.  I've taken several peeps there and everyone is like, WOW!!!!  From the Hen House (egg salad) to roast beef, it really is all good.  The owner and staff are such a joy to talk with.  You're guaranteed a smile every time :-)
