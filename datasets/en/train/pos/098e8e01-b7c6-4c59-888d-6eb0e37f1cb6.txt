This place is amazing.  I grew up in California, and didn't think I'd find good Mexican food again after leaving.  It's awesome.  They even make their own tortillas.  If you've never had freshly made tortillas, you have to try them. They are so much better than what you can buy in the store.

Plus, they give you roasted onions, cabbage, salsa, and cucumbers with your meal, and the roasted jalapeno is delicious. This is my new favorite Mexican food place in Phoenix.
