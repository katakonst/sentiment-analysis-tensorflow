I've always been a fan of Pita Jungle, but this location takes the cake for service!
I call before I leave the office to get an order to go.  They tell me 15 minutes.  When I arrive 15 minutes later, my order is ready!  
The service here is always friendly and they know my name.  The place is clean, too.
The back patio is huge and they have free wifi.  There's even a small bar outside, looking in.  I've never seen it completely empty. 
So glad we finally have a Pita Jungle in CenPho!!!
