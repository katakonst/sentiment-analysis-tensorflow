No one? Really? No one has written a review?!

I've walked past Fashion by Robert Black more times than I can count. Unfortunately, it was ALWAYS closed. I would pause at the window staring lustfully at all the beautiful treasures and curse this Robert person for not having better hours. Well, no more! They are open on Sunday---no better way to spend a Sunday than brunching and vintage shopping.

Let me just tell you a few things:

1) I will NEVER buy jewelry/sunglasses/accessories anywhere else (lie, but that is how I felt after browsing their collection of beauties).

2. Amazing hats. The Derby never looked so good. 

3. The woman, wish I remembered her name, working on Sundays is a total gem. If you don't fall in love with her (and vintage shopping) something is wrong with you. Or you're a burly straight man, and then I totally understand.
