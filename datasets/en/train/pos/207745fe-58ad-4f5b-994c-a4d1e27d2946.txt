Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.

Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.

And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette).
