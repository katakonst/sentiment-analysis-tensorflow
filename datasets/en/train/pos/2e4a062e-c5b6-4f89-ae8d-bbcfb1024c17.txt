Loved it!  This was my first time to this location and they did not let me down.  If you ever go here - GET THE avocado egg rolls!!  WOW amazing, and they give you this sauce that is like candy.  My niece went with me and she does not like to try anything so I got to eat all them suckers by myself!!!  haha..

I had the sliders and wedge fries and there was so much food I had lunch to bring home to my wife too.  Great service and friendly cool environment!  I will be back to try other stuff - their pasta looked delish so I wanna try that!!
