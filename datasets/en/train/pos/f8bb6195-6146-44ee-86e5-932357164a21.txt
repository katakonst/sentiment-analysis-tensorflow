This is the best movie theater in the world. Why? Because nobody ever goes here. More than likely a result of the light rail or people just not wanting to go downtown for a movie. But honestly, only once have I ever gotten a bad seat and it was opening night for the Simpsons and we showed up ten minutes before the show.

Parking validation rules. Their popcorn rules. Their blue icees rule. 

Did I mention this was my favorite movie theater?
