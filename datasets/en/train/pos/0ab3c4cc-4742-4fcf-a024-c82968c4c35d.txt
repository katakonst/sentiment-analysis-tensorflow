Love me some hidden house! 

The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.
