I just stopped by here today for lunch and am so happy I did.  I've driven by a number of times and just never went in.  

I ordered the Combo sub on an Italian roll.  So good.  Everything I was hoping for.  They had a fresh deli and frozen section with all sorts of frozen pastas.  They also sell canolli baked fresh everyday.  I could definitely get in touch with my eye-talian roots here.

I will most definitely be back on a regular basis for dinner, canolli, parties, Italian beer, you name it!  Mamma mia!
