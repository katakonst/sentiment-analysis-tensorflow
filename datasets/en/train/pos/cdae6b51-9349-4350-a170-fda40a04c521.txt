I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous. RIDICULOUS. 

Elderly people work here or volunteer. You expect customer service that you'd receive at a high-end store. No. People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices. No, the people there will not be making sure you're finding everything okay, you're on your own... and that's how it should be when you're thrifting.

I usually find great things. Glasswares, books, shoes, purses. They have amazing furniture that is so cheap. They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week.

Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays.
