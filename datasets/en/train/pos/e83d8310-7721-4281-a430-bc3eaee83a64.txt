BOOM goes the taco dynamite.  My co-workers and I (all of us except the vegetarian, not sure who invited him) thoroughly enjoyed the beef and chicken tacos.  The hard taco shells are the perfect combination of crispy and soft and the toppings were generous.  5 stars, two thumbs up and whatever other positive affirmation you appreciate. 

It was a serious work affair, so we didn't get the chance to worked destroy the tequila selection, unfortunately.  Next time Cien Agaves, next time.
