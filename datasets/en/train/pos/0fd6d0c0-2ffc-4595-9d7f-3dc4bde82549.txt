BEST CHEESE-STEAK IN ARIZONA.  BEST MEATBALL SUBS IN THE WEST.
I am from New Jersey and have eaten all up and down the east coast.  this place is a real jewel, only authentic italian deli i have found here in arizona. Try the cheesesteak on the italian baguette (crispy outside soft inside)  Pasta, deli you can't go wrong here.

 It's important to understand that everything is home made and takes time.  more than you may think approx 15-20 minutes for most orders. CALL YOUR EAT IN ORDER AHEAD OF TIME- then you will love coming here often.  
they sell limited quantities of pizza dough daily to make at home.  it's amazing and cheap!
