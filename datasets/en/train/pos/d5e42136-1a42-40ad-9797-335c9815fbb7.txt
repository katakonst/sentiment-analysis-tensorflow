I like Bookmans over Barnes and Noble because there is a large selection of lightly used books/DVDs/video games selling for half price. Also they're a great place to buy magazines for those airplane rides/road trips. Bookmans usually has the issues for the current year, so if you don't mind having someone else's address on your magazine this place is for you.

You can also trade in your books/CDs/DVDs for store credit. I don't recommend selling your stuff for cash because the offer they give is VERY low.
