2 floors of accessories!  I'm not sure who Charlie is, but he/she has definitely charmed me with his/her store!  I wish they had a Charming Charlie in Tempe.  Then again, it's probably for the best because I would end up spending all my time (and a good chunk of money) in there.  Charming Charlie is kind of like the accessory-heavy version of a Forever 21.  The main focus of the store is accessories with a few pieces of clothing vs. Forever 21.  The jewelry is all very trendy, and inexpensive, and there are also cute shoes, scarves, and hats for purchase as well.  Everything is color-coded which makes browsing easier.

EDIT: They do have a Charming Charlie in Tempe Marketplace!  How will my credit card ever survive? : )
