seriously, urban beans is one of my favorite spots right now...and has been for quite some time! their coffee drinks are amazing and you can just smell the quality when you walk in the door. their food, although you may not necessarily think to order it, is outstanding. service is awesome; they are so genuine and friendly! i think their food options are even on the healthier side... so A+ for that! 

in addition, they hosted a series of wine tasting events, two of which i attended... so much fun! definitely look into their upcoming events when you can, as they take a lot of care in planning and making sure their customers are happy happy happy :)

a must-try!
