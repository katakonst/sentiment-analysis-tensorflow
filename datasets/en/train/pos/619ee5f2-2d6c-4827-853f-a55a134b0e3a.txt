Oh man this place is awesome!! I walked out with a very heavy box of booze for $85.

Bleu cheese stuffed olives, Gibson onions, Stoli, giant bottle of Bombay Sapphire, Vermouth, six-pack of Stella, Three Philosophers beer, cheap shiraz. 

Wal-Mart is to white-trash as Bevmo is to Nathan "Bear Hands" S.

The staff was super helpful-friendly. The girl at the counter even gave me an extra $10 discount. Jesi thinks it is because I signed up for their discount card; I think it is because I am super cute. Either way, if anyone wants to know where to Christmas shop for me...
