Decided to go here because of the reviews here..  Picked up the Lucky Burger with 1000 Island dressing, took a bite and literally said..

"My God that's a good burger..."

and had to pause to write this real quick.  I'll let you know how the rest was shortly...

**after burger**

Holy s***...

The charbroil taste of every bite along with the flavor of meat, 1000island dressing and the veggies just sent this burger to the top of my list.

Imagine going to a family BBQ and everyone's favorite grill master is behind the grill doing his work.. this is what it's like.

The fries were also fresh and crunchy, just the way I like it.

Glad this is close to work, cause I will be a regular here.  

...sucks im on a diet!
