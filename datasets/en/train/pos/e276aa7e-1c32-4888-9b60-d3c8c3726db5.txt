You gotta love a place like Bertha's!  It just has a great FEEL when you walk in the front door.  Despite a line of about 10 in front of us, we gave our order in less than 3 minutes from arrival.   I ordered the Asparagus and Harvati Panini with chicken, and my partner ordered the chicken club.

You order at the counter and grab a seat if you are dining in.  I saw a lot of folks taking out and many regulars who had phoned their orders in.  We waited maybe 5 minutes max and were rewarded with ample sized sandwiches, that were fresh and tasty; along with a totally decadent chocolate cookie.  I would have tried their daily soup, but it was 110 degrees out so I will wait until Winter.

Good food, great service, easy to dance to. I gave it a 5!
