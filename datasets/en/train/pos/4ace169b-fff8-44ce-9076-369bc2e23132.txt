I am usually very picky about eating dinner at a sports grill. However, Blue 32 has great food, good appetizers, timely service during games, and a balanced environment. 
Usually in a sports bar on a Saturday night the service is slow and the food takes forever to make it to the table. Blue 32 was the opposite. Salad came out right after I ordered and the food was out before I finished my salad. I've been here a few times and every time has been a great experience.
