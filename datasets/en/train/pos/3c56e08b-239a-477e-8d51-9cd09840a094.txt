This review is for the liquor dept. 

I must admit, I am impressed. Ed, who took care of our order for some wine we wanted for a party, went above and beyond. He not only helped us place an order for the product which wasnt available, made sure he got in time, called us when it came in and ensured we got the best price for the product. 

Also, the man knows his liquor. I feel for his liver :) Jokes apart, he was very knowledgeable about his department and helped me make an informed decision on some other spirits we wanted to get. 

Excellent service. I will def be coming back even though I know the prices are slightly on the higher end.
