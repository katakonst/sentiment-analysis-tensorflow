Note to management - The crew you had working this past Monday night is your "A" TEAM. My calzone was cooked to perfection, my only regret is that I didn't take a picture of it. My dinning companions were equally impressed with the hot meatball sandwich and chicken parmasean. It was a perfect meal after driving back from the left coast. The service was outstanding too.
