A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the "main" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.

$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.

Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.

Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!
