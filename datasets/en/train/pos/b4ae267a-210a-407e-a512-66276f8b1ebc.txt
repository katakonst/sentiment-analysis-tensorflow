The food, the atmoshere, the service... it was all just top notch.  

Everything was excellent, but I especially enjoyed the paella.  It was outstanding, the best paella I've had.  Just be aware, it's a little different (in a great way) than most paellas in that the rice is fully cooked, but remains just very slightly al dente.  Too many paellas have soggy rice, but the texture of the rice here really brings the dish to a higher level.

Everything was excellent.
