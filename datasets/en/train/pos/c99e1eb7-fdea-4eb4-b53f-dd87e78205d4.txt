Seriously I'm glad I don't live in Arizona or I'd weight 400 pounds! I had wings here every Tuesday night for wing night....I was down in Arizona in 2008 and it was my first stop....yeah you heard me...not to see friends who I missed...it was I'm going to Native see you there with my wings and beer....seriously I think I'm drooling while writing this review....I've never had anything else on their menu just the wings....it's all about the wings and beer...lots of wings and beer..... 

WINGS AND BEEEEER!!!!! 

and I wonder why I gained 20 pounds?!?
