I love the 99 Cent store. Not only is it super cheap but they have a good selection of things and fresh produce! This place is a broke college kid's haven; it has like 5 packs of ramen for 99 cents and energy drinks, and water. It's always a stop when I have to do some shopping. Oh, tip for getting yummy produce before it's all out - go at opening when they're stocking their produce section. I get a lot of salad ingredients and a lot of my fruit from here.
