"One of the Best Ribs,  A Must try for any BBQ Fans" 

 This location will offer the same quality food the original  Phoenix location started for stacy as the restaurant opens its second location.  BBQ Ribs (pork and beef) really tender pulled pork and lots of combos  to choose from.

The location is clean and looks like it will have a bbq drive-thru window!
