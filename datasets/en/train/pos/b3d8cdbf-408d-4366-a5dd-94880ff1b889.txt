I didn't even know I could yelp about a post office!

I live across the street from this post office and am quite the regular here.  I am obsessed with sending mail, so I'm always in need of stamps and special two day deliveries to cheer friends up!

I LOVE this post office.  I think someone else said those exact words, but seriously, this is the most amazing post office in the world.  Every single person that works there is incredibly helpful and kind.  They are always smiling and have become my friends.  Yes, I am friends with post office workers... but once you use this post office, you'll want to be friends with them too. 

If I ever moved out of this neighborhood, I would go out of my way to continue using this post office!
