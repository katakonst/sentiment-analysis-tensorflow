Thirty-Touche'!!!

The Mint Lemondrop Martini is THE BEST martini in town!  A little frothy, not too sweet, great flavor and it packs a punch!  I come here often for happy hour and wish there were a few bar type munchies on the menu to go with the great drinks.  So, instead I get a sandwich and I'm good for the evening - love the turkey with cranberries.  The toasted cibatta bread gives crunch and texture.

I'm glad this is my 'hood. Looking forward to when everything else nearby updates to this standard.  They also have events to promote community, look for the mommy and me, dog days, etc.  

Love patronizing our local indy businesses who work this hard to make a dream come true!
