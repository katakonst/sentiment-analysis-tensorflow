Stayed with a toddler and an infant. The hotel provided a baby-crib. This hotel is a short drive away from Scottsdale downtown and near to freeways that gets you to most attractions fairly quickly.

We got the 1 bedroom suites which were great for the kids to have additional space in the TV/dining/kitchenette area to play in. The room is spacious. Fixtures a little dated but all works fine.

The provided breakfast was great. We ate there daily while we were there. Daily change of hot breakfast, including omelettes, sausages, a automatic pancake machine. Has cereal, yogurt, fresh milk as well. May be crowded in the morning, so go early.
