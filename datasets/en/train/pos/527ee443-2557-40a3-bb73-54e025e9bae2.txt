I dream about her.

We were standing in line in the pouring rain in front of a food truck.  My hands were numb from the cold.  The lobster lady smiled as she handed us the huge chunks of lobster with a very light garlic dressing on a butter toasted roll.

It was surreal, as if we were walking alongside a seaside village enjoying our eats straight from a fishmonger.  I know that hubby was quite satisfied with his coz I didn't hear a peep.  "I don't like it that much", my little cutie pie handed me his piece.  I didn't argue this time about not finishing his meal.  "I like crab better."  More for me.

We will be tracking The Maine Lobster Lady down like epicurean stalkers!
