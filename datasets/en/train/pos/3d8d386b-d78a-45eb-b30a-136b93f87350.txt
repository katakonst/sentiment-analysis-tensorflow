This is no ordinary Denny's!  Whether it's the stereotypical drunk Scottsdale douches fighting in the restaurant or wasted skanks having diarrhea in the parking lot, this Denny's is guaranteed to entertain. I've witnessed some crazy and disturbing shit (literally) at this place while enjoying a Denny's Bacon Slam Burger and chocolate shake at 2am after a night out at the the Dogg or Ernie's. I'll only eat at this Denny's.  All other Denny's simply aren't worth it!
