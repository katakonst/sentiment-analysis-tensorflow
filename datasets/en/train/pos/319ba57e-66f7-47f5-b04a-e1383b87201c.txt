This is definitely a take-your-date-here-if-you-wanna-get-laid type of place. 

My friend and I checked it out on a Friday night a few weeks ago, I'm all about the low lighting and it's very dark and cool. Lots of handsome African American men in suits and hats. Soul Power was playing, which is an r&b and funk cover band, they were awesome! I got some Mardi Gras beads and I didn't have to do anything dirty. We got wasted and danced our asses off to Michael Jackson..super fun time!
