Dr. Jay is the most talented, thorough and effective chiropractor I've ever been treated by, in my 25 years of being treated for injuries from competitive running, climbing, diving, gymnastics, wrestling, polo and weightlifting. 

I say "talented" because I've never had a chiropractor affect an adjustment so quickly and seemingly effortlessly, with such a light touch. He is "thorough" because he approaches each problem from a variety of directions, and is careful in taking a history and listening to me. He's "effective" because he actually has fixed my issues and restored me to greater mobility, and relieved my pain. 

I've been treated by more than 12 chiropractors over the last 25 years, and yet I remained skeptical of chiropractic until I was treated by Nicholas Jay. Now I recommend his services as a "first resort" to the more than 200 athletes I train.
