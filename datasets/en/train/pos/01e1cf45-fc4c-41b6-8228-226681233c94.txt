This place reminds me of Cheers except that only one bartender knew my name.

..I hope that joke was somewhat funny.

Prankster is really cheap (except for Budlight) and all of the servers and bartenders are really friendly. I brought a few friends here for drinks and they liked the atmosphere and prices too.

They have a lot of TVs so you can watch your favorite games with your friends. The people who come here are in their 30's and 40's. I once sat next to a guy in his sixties who was drinking car bombs. I hope his liver is okay!

Overall, this place is great. If you want to hang out with college students, you can go to the Vine. But you'll have slower and less friendly service. Plus, you'll pay more for your meals.
