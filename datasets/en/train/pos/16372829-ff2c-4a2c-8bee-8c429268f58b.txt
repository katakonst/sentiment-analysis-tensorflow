Oh I always feel So much better after getting my feet scrubbed! I've tried a few places around where I live, but I keep going back to this one. Great service, fair price and excellent attention to detail. Love the way my teeny tiny toes sparkle after walking out of here. Oh, be sure to try the sugar scrub and the "cooling" potion they put on your feet is awesome.
