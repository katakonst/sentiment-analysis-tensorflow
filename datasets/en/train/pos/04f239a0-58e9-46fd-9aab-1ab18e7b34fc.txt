Costco is my religion. It is my heart, blood, and soul. It is my lord, and personal savior. It's my Madonna. Everything at Costco is amazing. Everything. I will fight or slice someone who dare speak ill of Costco. I wish that everything I own, use, and operate was Kirkland brand. I want a Kirkland wedding, and a Kirkland created husband.  I dream of the day that Costco rules the United States in a form of glorious Communist Retail Utopia!
