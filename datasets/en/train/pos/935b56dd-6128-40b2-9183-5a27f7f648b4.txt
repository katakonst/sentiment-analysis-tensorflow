This place is great for football - they have plenty of screens and give you a TV layout of which games are on which TV. If you get there early enough, you've got your pick of tables so that you can watch whatever game you want.

The morning games are easier to get a table then the afternoon ones - when we left, there was a line out the door and people were pouncing on you to see if you were staying for the afternoon games or leaving.

The food was good too, and they serve a breakfast menu till 10:30.
