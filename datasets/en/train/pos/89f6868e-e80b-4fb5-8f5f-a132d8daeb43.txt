To start, the chicken wings are fantastic.

The pizza is good as well. I prefer either the cheese pizza or the "Gladiator" pizza (sausage and pepperoni).

Burgers -- whether it be the cheeseburger or "Hurricane Fish Sandwich" -- are excellent.

The food is simple, but remarkably delightful.

My only problem with LGO's pizzeria is parking (or rather, lack thereof). This is especially true if you visit at peak-dinnertime hours.

And don't be the dude (or chick) that parks in a curbside parking spot -- without the intention of using cURBSIDE SERVICES -- only to spend two hours eATing INSIDE!!!! Use the valet, please.

Thank you.
