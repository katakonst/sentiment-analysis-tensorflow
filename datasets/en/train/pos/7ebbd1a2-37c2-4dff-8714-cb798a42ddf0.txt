Chino Bandido is a staple.  The Jade Chicken and Emerald Chicken are particularly excellent.  Ordering by filling out a form is optional at this less-busy Chandler location (whereas required at the busier Phoenix location), but is a key piece of the experience.  
Snickerdoodle cookies are the default dessert.
