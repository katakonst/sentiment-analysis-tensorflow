Wonderful Happy Hour, as most of their appetizers and drinks are half off.  They have the best crab fried in the nation!  Ambience is hip and young, with many of the local Scottsdale people in for their meal, as well as visitors to the area. Décor is modern Asian, with a twist of contemporary.  Nice open space, good for large groups, but expect long wait times
