Ever since I moved to the Tempe area, I've been making occasional appearances whenever I stopped by Fujiya next store.

Surprisingly though, I've stopped by twice this week!  Now my wallet [I spent at least $20 each time]and waistline begs me to stop, I'm addicted to their sukiyaki beef sandwiches on fluffy white bread and their miscellaneous selection of adorable and yummy pastries.

While I sit here typing this review, my mind is wandering to the green tea mousse, green tea pudding, and the cute cream puff in the fridge.  Yummy!

Now if they would just hire me...!
