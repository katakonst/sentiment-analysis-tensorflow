We have tried several pizza places in the 6 + months we have been in the valley. So in our progression we came across Lucky's. Man what a great place, ordered 2 large NYS pizzas and 10 wings, wanted to get a feel for their wares.

WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!! I have 5 people in my family and we had almost a whole pizza left for the upcoming week. There is nothing much better that really good pizza that you can eat on all week.

Give these guys a try, you can feed the whole family and not break the bank!
