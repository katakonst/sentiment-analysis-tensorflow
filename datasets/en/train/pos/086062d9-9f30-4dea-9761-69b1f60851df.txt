This is our favorite pizza place...we probably go once a week and enjoy ourselves every single time. The pizza is AMAZING!! We always get the same thing,  a large (cause we always want to take some home!) thin crust pizza with green olives, feta and salami... and it is literally the best pizza we've ever had! Wednesday nights they have 1/2 of a bottle of wine and their house red is pretty good. Very family friendly (sometimes too many families...) but the patio is always a good, chill option. Def dont pass up an opportunity to experience Spinatos!
