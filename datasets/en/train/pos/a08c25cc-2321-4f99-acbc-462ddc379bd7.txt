This yogurt is as good as it gets. Plus, they are fair and reasonable to the consumer, with prices at 37¢ per ounce which is OK in a day and age where cute little yogurt shops are opening and trying to get like 44¢ per ounce. The store is always clean and fresh, and they have a wonderful selection of flavors, constantly changing. The staff is friendly and nice, and they offer a great variety of toppings. Their toppings bar is kept clean and cold, and is the best one in Phoenix. I'd like to request that the owners put up allergens warnings on their machines if the yogurt contains eggs or nuts.
