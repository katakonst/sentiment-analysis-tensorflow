This is now my favorite Mexican food eatery!  Wow....Love it.  
The service last night was impeccable, and the food to die for.  I had the spinach enchalida's and hubby had the chili relano.  Yummy on both with some very cold beers.  It doesn't get better than this.
Looks like they have a great happy hour as well, that we plan on frequenting. 
Highly recommend this great place!!
