I was really impressed by the service here, quick, friendly and awesome.  

I did a quick scan of the wall of teas to choose from and settled on Yerba Mate as soon as I saw it because it reminded me of Logie and her crazy tea thread.  The tea was brewed to perfection and in three minutes I was drinking delicious iced tea.  

This is a really laid back place and I always see people on their laptops here so I'm assuming they have free wifi too.  Cool decor - my new favorite coffee house.
