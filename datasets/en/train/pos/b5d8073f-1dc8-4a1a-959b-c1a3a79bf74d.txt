Great sound, nicely laid out space, good service, solid beers on tap... This place is a game-changer. The lounge area on the street is awesome, and opens today (and everyday) from four PM till 2 AM. The concert space is great, as well. A knee-high stage has plenty of room for large acts, while in the back of the room, tired/lame attendees can relax in the bleachers. The bathrooms, while boring,  were spotless. We'll see how long that lasts, haha. 

I can't WAIT to update this review with more experiences. (ESPECIALLY FOOD!!! Next week!!!!!)
