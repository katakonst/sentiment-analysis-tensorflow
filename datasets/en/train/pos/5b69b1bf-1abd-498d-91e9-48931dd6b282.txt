Defalco's is one of my favorite lunch spots. I read the reviews that talk about the lines, I have to tell you I never saw them as that bad. Sure, you have to wait a few minutes, but it generally works out ok. One item not mentioned thus far, an item not on the menu but something they'll make any time is the Portabello mushroom sandwich. The grocery items seem expensive, but the sandwiches are completely reasonable


I'm not sure how they are doing right now with the tomato scare, but I know I'll be visiting Defalco's again soon.
