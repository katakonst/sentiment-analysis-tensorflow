I can't get enough of Wildflower Bread Company! Can you tell?
Did you know they use wild Alaskan salmon in their salads,etc? 
Did you know they use cage-free, antibiotic-free, hormone-free chicken in their chicken dishes? 
Always very fresh, always consistent, delicious food--and that's as close to perfect as a restaurant can get! 
I finally tried something a little different today: 1/2 roast beef and gorgonzola sandwich and 1/2 Caesar salad...FABULOUS! Every bite was pure deliciousness! 
Although I'm trying to cut the sweets, I'm going to indulge in a cupcake or a piece of cake next visit....they look wonderful, as well! 
This place ROCKS!
