Only been here once, but I absolutely love this place. It almost feels like a wine bar when you walk in- appropriately sparse lighting, hip decor, and an openness that beckons you to relax and enjoy. The staff doesn't feel like the airport TSA, which is a welcome change from comparable Phoenix venues. 

Having access to real food at a show is a MAJOR plus. It's damn tasty, too.  Drinks are good, not great, but reasonably priced. 

The best part: probably the best sound system of any venue I've ever been to- I could hear each instrument from each band member with crystal clarity, nearly perfect balance, and tonal accuracy. The stage is clean, large, and looks like a TV showcase.

Love.
