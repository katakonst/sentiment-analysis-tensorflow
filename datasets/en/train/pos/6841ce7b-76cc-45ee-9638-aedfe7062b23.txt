Noble Beast has a fantastic selection of super premium pet food.  It is one of the only places in town that sells Evo by Innova.  I also discovered "Sam's Yams" here, which my puppy absolutely loves.  The staff is extremely knowledgable about pet foods and super nice.  The only downside?  Too many cool things to buy your pet!  The last time I was in there I dropped $148 in about 10 minuted.  Ouch.  The dog is eating better than me.  I just had a bowl of cereal for dinner.
