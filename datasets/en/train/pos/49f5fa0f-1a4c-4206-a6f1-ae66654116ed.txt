Yes, I agree this place is a gem.  I have always had terrific food here (the gyros and salad's  are awesome).  ALWAYS fresh.  A little expensive considering it's a dive (a very clean one though).  And i have had co-workers complain they don't give you enough food.  But giving 5 stars based on the quality of the food
