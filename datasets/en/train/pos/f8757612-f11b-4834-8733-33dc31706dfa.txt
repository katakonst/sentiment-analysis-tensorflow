I just went here for the first time tonight with my family and had a great time.  The food was delicious, but what really sold it for me was our outstanding service.  We were helped by Maria and she was a total sweetheart!  She knew the menu very well, gave great recommendations, and made sure we had everything we needed.

As for the food, I had a gluten-free pizza and their crust was really yummy (which can sometimes be a challenge when doing things gluten-free)!  My family had a pizza, calzone, salad, and dessert, and they were all very satisfied with their selections.  

I do wish they were able to serve alcohol, but that did not ruin the dinner whatsoever.  Plenty of parking out front and this location is right down the street from Tempe Marketplace.

Highly recommended!
