Being a new vegetarian, I am trying my darndest to find veggie-friendly restaurants that offer variety and don't suck the life out of my wallet. GREEN is, by far, the most brilliant. I went for lunch, and the staff was friendly, the food was awesome and the atmosphere was very laid-back-- not too hipstery, not too commercial.
My favorite thing, though, was the fact that the "pseudo meats" were super yummy... sometimes they really just taste like cardboard. But not at GREEN!
Yay GREEN!
ps. The Tsoynami is also ridiculously yummy. Get the peanut butter and chocolate.
