yay for conspire.  it's my neighborhood coffee shop and i'm glad.  it's mysterious and friendly, host to a variety of theme nights and open late.

for gifty and handcrafted items conspire should definitely be one of your stops (and not just on first friday).  the house is filled with locally made garments, jewelry, paintings, buttons, patches, and other things.  they also appear to be carrying vegan baked goods from cuppycake cakery!  when i was in the other night they had 3 kinds of cookies- i tried the peanut butter and they were great.
