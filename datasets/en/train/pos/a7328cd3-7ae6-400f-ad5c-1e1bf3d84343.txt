Hellllo Redendo's.  How you doin'?  

Why oh why didn't I discover this place before I bid adieu to North Scottsdale??  Damn me and my ignorance.

This is such a great Italian restaurant- the prices are great and the food is fabulous.  

They have amazing pizza, calzones, heros, pasta and garlic knots (why must you be so buttery and delicious and full of fat??).  Seriously, everything this Redendo master-chef touches turns to Italian gold. 

Every time I try to leave this place, I end up going back for a cannoli. Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in!
