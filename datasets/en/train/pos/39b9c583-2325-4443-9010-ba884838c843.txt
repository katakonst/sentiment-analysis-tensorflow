Returned for a recent breakfast, and can't stop thinking about how much I enjoyed it.  I did an omelet, which was great, but I LOVED their coffee.  What a nice morning.

Now that they're doing happy hour, i need to get back here in the evening, especially now that it's nice enough to really enjoy the patio.
