My BF met Duane at a Circle K four years ago.  He saw a 'handyman' truck and struck up conversation.  Duane has since worked on 30 of the 40 units in our complex.  He is our 'go-to guy' for everything... paint, drywall, hanging chandeliers and ceiling fans, reworking electrical, fixing kitchen and bathroom plumbing, and more.  He's more than affordable, extremely professional, and personable as well.  He's fantastic with dogs, and trustworthy enough that we feel 100% comfortable leaving for the day with Duane in our home.

If you're looking for a handyman, Duane is your man!
