We went to Maizie's last night, probably our sixth or seventh trip there.  I love the stuffed pizza burger, it's a pretty amazing take on the classic American burger.  Last night we wanted to try something new so we split the Sonoran Chicken Panini and the Sonoran Stuffed Burger.  Both were excellent.  We have tried several other items from the Buffalo Dip to the Sangria and everything is always good.  Waitstaff is friendly and seem to know everybody while the atmosphere cozy, classic and fun.  I highly recommend, Maizie's is one of my favorite uptown spots.
