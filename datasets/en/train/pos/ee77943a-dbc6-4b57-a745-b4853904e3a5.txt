This was the cutest wine store!  I loved it.

I went there for an event, so I really was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere of the store.  (I thought it was going to be more of a restaurant...I obviously know NOTHING!)  The wine was great, the staff was very friendly, and I just thought the place was cute.  Cute Cute Cute.

I also love the t-shirts that were available for sale..."Women Taste Better"  I love it!
