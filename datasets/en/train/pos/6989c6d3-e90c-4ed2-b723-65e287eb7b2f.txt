I love Teharu, I constantly compare this restaurant to the uber expensive sushi places and it not only holds its own but in many cases (like the Vegas roll) it blows places like RA out of the water. The best part is its 1/4 the price of other places. Word of caution is the lunch and dinner rushes are nuts so go at an odd time like 1:30
