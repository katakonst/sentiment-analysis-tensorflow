A true drunk shopping paradise! So many hats and accessories to try on and be all super model-like. After many buckets of beers, many shots of tequilla and my trying to set the plants inside on fire (they should not leave all of those matches within the reach of drunken people) next door at Pink Taco, Forest, Brian and I made our way over to UO. 

As Forest and I gleefully tried on hats and took pictures of each other Brian quickly moved away from us...we kept trying to put hats on his head and take his picture. No bueno! We made Forest buy yet another winter coat. Buying winter coats (even if you live in Scottsdale) seems like such a great idea when you are drunk. Buying fuschia leather hot pants also seems like a good idea when you are drunk, but that's another story.
