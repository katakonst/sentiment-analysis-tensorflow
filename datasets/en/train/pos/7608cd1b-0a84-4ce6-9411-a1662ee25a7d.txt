You're downtown, you want interesting pizza options without the 5 hour wait, and your hunrgy...

That's me.

Funny thing is, I actually didn't like this place at first, but now it's a first choice.

It's a cute little place with delicious food. Never had a problem, and rarely do I wait (but I'm an early eater). Never tried their lunch options, however.

I recommend the pesto salad, prosciutto pizza, and you need to try a crepe. MARSCAPONE AND NUTELLA?????? Umm, OK!

DROOOOOL....
