I haven't used my library card in over a year (no idea how i racked up the $20 in over-due fees). 

Anyhow, what i luv about this place?  The used book corner.  This is where u can snag mags, children's books, novels, cd's, videos, altas, library discards, ect.  I like donating my books, but I LOVE picking thought the selection of goodies for 25 & 50 cents.

Reminds me, my shelves are over-flowing - time to donate again.
