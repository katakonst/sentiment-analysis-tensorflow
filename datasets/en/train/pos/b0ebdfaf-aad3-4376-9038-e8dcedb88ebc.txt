This place is so freaking good. I've only ever ordered one item and that's the veggie sub. Maybe sometime I'll try the cheese one but if it ain't broke... The mayo is the best I've ever had. I love their ice. Great ice. 

The patio is misted. The decor is fun. Totally worth the drive if you're in a 7.5 mile range.
