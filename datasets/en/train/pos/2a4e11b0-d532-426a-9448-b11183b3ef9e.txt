Wow, I can't believe some of these reviews. WTF were you expecting, a metrosexual/bi/trendy dive where the bartenders juggle balls of fire? It's in a stripmall North of the Bashas. I don't even know what other stores are in the stripmall, but Pomeroy's is right behind the Starbucks.

Anyway, they have Bell's Oberon and an awesome selection of other beers. They also stock about a dozen beers on tap and a decent food menu. If this doesn't cut it for you, there's a plethora of overpriced places nearby on Camelback for you to blow your money at. At least you can feel less insecure about yourself knowing you're a total douchebag or stuck-up bitch.
