I have been a regular here for over 4 years. Everyone knows my name (the Cheers theme song popped in my head after typing that). I eat here frequently by myself, with my spouse and with friends. When I have vendors at work take our team out to lunch I always bring them here. I also always choose Mikado to host my birthday dinner. Mikado's has lots of new regulars because of me! :)   The sushi is so fresh and I haven't found anywhere else in the valley that can beat their prices!
