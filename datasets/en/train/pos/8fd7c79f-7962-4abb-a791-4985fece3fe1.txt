This place has a small assortment of pastries and breads made fresh and with obvious love for quality product.

While located far from where live, we like to drop in before our favorite pastry (which I am not disclosing, so as to have less competition), disappears. The breads are all good.

Try getting to the place early, as stuff disappears by the end of the day. There is a small selection of bottled/canned drinks as well, so if your desire to eat something cannot be contained, you'll have something to wash all the goodness down with.
