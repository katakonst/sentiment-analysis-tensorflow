Pretty much no shopping experience makes me as happy as going to Costco. Their pizza is reason enough not to jump. Big portions of life make me happy. I like the fact that it's membership only. Keeps the riff raff at bay. F-ing riff raff. 

What is riff raff? 

I can't think of one negative thing to say about except that the female employees don't seem to like being stared at by my weasely eyes. GOSH!
