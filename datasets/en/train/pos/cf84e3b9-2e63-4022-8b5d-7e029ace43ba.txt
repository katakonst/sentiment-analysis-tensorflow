I have been eating here for years. It's always just as as good as the last time. The service is always attentive, the Pho is wonderful and large, the herb plate is generous, and it's very clean. The level of ambiance is about 0 and it feels a little like a cafeteria, but what do you expect from an ethnic dive where their specialty is a $6 bowl of soup exquisite soup? That adds a certain charm to it.
