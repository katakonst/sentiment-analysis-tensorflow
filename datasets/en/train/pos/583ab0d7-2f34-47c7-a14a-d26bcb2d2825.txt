A local burger joint that's been around for as long as I can remember. Sometimes it's hard to pick out what to eat since there are a billion items on their menu.

The last time I went, I ordered the sourdough double cheese burger with bacon and avocado.

How was it? It was as if a sourdough jack made a beautiful baby with a BLT. Grilled sourdough with 2 burger patties, american cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and generous portions of avocado. One word, amazing.

I've also had the gyro here, which was better than My Big Fat Greek Restaurant IMO.
