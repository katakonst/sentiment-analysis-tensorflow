Finally a great Scottsdale breakfast eatery. I have tried the other places, and never got the hype on the other spots. Dottie's is the real deal. Unlike many other spots, where one item is the star, and other things are passable to downright lame, Dottie's nails it all. Every aspect on your plate is the most important one, and they really pay attention to details.

My friend and I grabbed breakfast there, and it was delicious. The server, Choloe, was funny, efficient, and friendly. Our coffee and juices were filled and she was everywhere at once, without being obtrusive. I really enjoyed my breakfast, which was a ton of high quality food, and a good price. I will be back for more, and look forward to lunch there as well. Dottie's is True Blue in my book for sure!
