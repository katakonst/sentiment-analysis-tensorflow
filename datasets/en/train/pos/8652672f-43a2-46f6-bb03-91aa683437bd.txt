This is my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.  It's a small place with seating for probably about 15~20.  My favorites are fish taco, shrimp taco, chicken tortilla soup and quesadilla with carne asada.  salad and burritos are very good too.  Also, try the salsas the lady makes fresh daily.  Once you try it, you'll be definitely going back.  It's a little hard to see it driving by.
