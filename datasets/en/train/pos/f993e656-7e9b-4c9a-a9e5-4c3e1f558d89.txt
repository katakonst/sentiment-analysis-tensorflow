Okay, I went here for breakfast this morning. The food is great, the eggs had a great texture, their made-to-order hash browns were cooked perfectly with just a little crunch and their waffles were light and tasted great with the fresh strawberries and whip cream we got on the side. 

When I walk into a place like Harlow's two things cross my mind, (1) old which leads to, (2) dirty bathrooms. I rode my bike so I had to go into the bathroom to wash my hands. I braced myself as I expected the worse, but a pleasant surprise was awaiting me! This bathroom experience was awesome! The room was clean, had mirrors on opposite sides which enlarged the space and beautiful wallpaper and porcine tiles. 

Great food, great bathroom, and great service. My top pick for breakfast joints!
