Copper Blues is a cool place to some and listen to some music or hear some comedy.   My husband and I have been to Copper Blues a couple of times now.  The staff is really great and the food is great too.   Also they have a huge selection of beer on top that you can choice from.  If you are ever in town for a business trip or on vacation you should check out Copper Blues in downtown Phoenix.  Thanks Copper Blues for being a great restaurant and pub.
