This is the first time I have been to Wok In, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean.  If you are a patron of those Express Chinese places (you know the one with the panda)...you will be impressed with this place, because 1...it is a sit down restaurant and 2... the food is better than theirs.  

The orange chicken is wonderful, lightly battered and deep fried with a flavorful sauce...hot, steamy and delicious...not hard with a ton of batter and over done.  The chicken pieces were of a nice size and the portion...lets say this I had to bring half of it home.  

The Thai Iced tea is wonderful and I was impressed with the value for the money.  I will make this my NEW place to get good Asian Fusion at a great price.
