Somehow I've become a semi-regular at Lisa G and I'm lovin' every minute of it.  The staff is wonderful and helpful and they seem like a family (there are only a few people that actually work there) which is a nice feeling.

The skewer plate is my favorite.  I've ate it many, many times in the last few months.  

Some new stuff:  They just re-did their patio and added a ton more seating!  They're also doing Saturday night projected movies on the patio and wine/five course meal pairings once a month.  There is lots of good stuff happening here- check it!
