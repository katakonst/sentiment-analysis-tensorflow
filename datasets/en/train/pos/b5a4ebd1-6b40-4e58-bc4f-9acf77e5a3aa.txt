I have been looking for a good NY style Chinese place since we moved here. I FOUND IT. This place is so good, the rice is fantastic, the food is very good. I got it to go so I don't care about the service or that there were kids in the dining room doing their homework.... its a family place.... get over it. The prices are great and the portions are great as well.  This is my new spot for takeout.
