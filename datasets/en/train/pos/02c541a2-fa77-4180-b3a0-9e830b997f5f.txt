New year, new clothes, time to update my closet.  A great way to sell some clothes for cash is at Buffalo Exchange.  They give you 33% for the value of the clothes or 50% for in store credit.  The staffs are so friendly.  I just love the store that doesn't smell like something died like other consignment stores.
