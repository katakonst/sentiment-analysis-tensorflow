If you eat here and don't like it, please leave the state immediately because you have no future here. 

The place was packed with old-time Avondalers on a Friday night. White and Hispanic alike. It's so far off the beaten path from where out of state newcomers have moved in as part of Phoenix's suburban sprawl, that it has a completely local flavor and feel for it that I'm sure has not changed since the day it opened in 1968. Main Street itself, cutting through "downtown Avondale", is a trip back to yesteryear. 

The salsa deserves six stars. You get a bowl of the regular tasty stuff. Then, plunked down right next to it, is a SECOND bowl of chopped salsa veggies like tomatoes, onions and the rest. Thus, you're free to mix up some chunky salsa according to your own unique personal preferences. YUM.
