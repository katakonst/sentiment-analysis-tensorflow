Let me start of by saying I am a picky eater!!!  I am in Phoenix often and can not believe I have not found this place until now.  What a great little place to grab a sandwich or salad.

I had the asparagus and Havarti panini, yum!!!  The baked goods are yummy also!  
This will be a regular spot for me from now on!
