Owned by former Phoenix Suns star Dan Majerle, Majerle's is great if you're here on a game night, even if you're not a huge sports fan. And if you're not a huge sports fan there's a good chance the person sitting next to you is someone well known in some sports league or another (you know, NBA, MLB, something like that).

I came here with a friend from out of town one night. Some college basketball game was on tv. As we enjoyed our beers and caught up on life, my friend laughed and said, "This place seems to be popular with aging frat boys." I asked him what made him say that, and he pointed to some guy sitting across the bar from us. It was Dan Majerle.
