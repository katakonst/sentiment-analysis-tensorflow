The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and I *guarantee you'll you have an interesting conversation. Unless you're the one who's not interesting.



*I can't really guarantee anything. Wtf.
