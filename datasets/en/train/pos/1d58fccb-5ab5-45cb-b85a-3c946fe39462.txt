unPhogettable is PHOnominal! Ok, bad joke aside, this is one of my new favorite Vietnamese restaurants. The food is extremely fresh and after talking with the owner, I found out that they make everything themselves from scratch with no MSG or prepackages meats. 

The service was excellent and the cafe setting was very inviting. Although a bit far from my house, I'll make the drive to come back here to eat again.
