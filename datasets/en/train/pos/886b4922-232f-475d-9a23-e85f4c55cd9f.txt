I have fallen head over heels in love with the Nearly Naked Theatre (aka N2T)! It consists of a team of local writers, actors, and technicians whose mission is to deliver entertaining theater free of censorship and corporate/political constraints. Although the theatre is small (seats 75 or so) and the sets are creatively homegrown, the writing and acting are extraordinary. I've seen Metamorphosis, Reefer Madness, The Rocky Horror Show, M. Butterfly, and Time Square Angel all in the last year and thoroughly enjoyed each and every one. I'm a huge fan and want you to be one too. So check out season 10's show schedule and support our local arts. See you at the show!
