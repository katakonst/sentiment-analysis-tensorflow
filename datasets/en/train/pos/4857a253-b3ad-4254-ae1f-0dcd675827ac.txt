YESSIR! It's a shame (or a blessing) this place isn't close to me... The people here are super friendly and the food is on point!

Had the mac and cheese bites... pretty much made me want to slap someone in the face because of the fried cheesy goodness. My favorite flavors so far are the seasoned and parmesan garlic wings!
