Although I've only dropped in here a few times, I've really fallen in love with this place. I just moved from LA back to Phoenix and I really wasn't expecting a whole lot returning home. I did not think a store like this could be found outside of the Bay Area, LA, or New York. They've got an awesome selection of clothing, hats, and vinyl records. The best thing about this place is the owners/staff. They're totally cool with you just hanging out and chatting and they even encourage you to dig around in the vinyl collection. They've got all the best things a hip-hop/street culture store has to offer and then some. If you're about real music and real style, this is the place to go in the Valley. Accept no substitutes.
