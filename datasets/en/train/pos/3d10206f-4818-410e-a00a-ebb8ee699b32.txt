Two blistered hands, one bruised knee, and a killer sunburn are souvenirs from my inaugural hike up the echo canyon trail.
It's more like rock climbing than hiking and it's a great workout because it requires both cardio and strength skills.

It's not a hike for those who are wanting solitude, but that's okay for me because I usually go alone and I would be thankful for the witnesses had I taken a nosedive off the side of the mountain.

Parking was awful on a Wednesday morning and I had to park 1/2 a mile down the street in a residential neighborhood.  The view from the top is amazing and well worth the effort.  Five Stars.
