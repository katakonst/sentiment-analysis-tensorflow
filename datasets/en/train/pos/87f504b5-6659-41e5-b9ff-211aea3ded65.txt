I was here about a month ago looking for this George Foreman grill.  I could not find it on the shelf so I was told to go to Customer Service for a rain check because it was on sell.  Chris at Customer Service look at the ad and checked his hand held device.  He told me to wait a second.  3 mins later, he came back with one.  YEAH, CHRIS!!!!  

Every time I am at this Target, someone always greets me or ask if I needed help.  Love this place!!!!
