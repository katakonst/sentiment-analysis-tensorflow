Awesome breakfast place. They seem to always have lots of people waiting and now I know why. We arrived with a group of over 10 people and they managed to push some tables together and seat us in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress was also super cheerful, fast and accurate. She got all of our orders right and managed to have all plates on the table at the same time.

Best oatmeal in town. They actually use the slow cooking whole grain Scottish oats and not that instant Quaker stuff. I love the healthy menu choices, such as light rye bread and egg white omelets. I had the spinach and feta egg white omelet and it was awesome. 

The menu is so extensive that you could literally come here for a month and never order the same thing twice.
