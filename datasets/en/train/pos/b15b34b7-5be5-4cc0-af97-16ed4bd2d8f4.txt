LOVE this place.  The tea and coffee is bold, unique and mighty tasty.  Five stars for quality. 

I always have a pleasant experience, and the staff remembered my name after my second visit!  I can get in, out and on my way in no time.  On the weekends I like to come here with a good book and enjoy a pastry with my coffee.  The waffles call my name.  Yes, they serve waffles.  

My gripes:  There could be more comfy chairs in place of all the tables and straight-backed chairs.  It's very chilly inside too, so bring a sweater if you plan on staying.
