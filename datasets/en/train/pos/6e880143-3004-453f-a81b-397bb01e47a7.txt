Having relocated from a city with a very large Asian population, I was a little afraid that I would have to do without my weekly Boba milk tea and it would now become a Christmas luxury in the "True north strong and free - Oh Canada!" Lucky for me and the other Boba lovers I stumbled upon the Boba Tea House in the valley! 

Lychee flavored Boba milk tea - enough said! I'll be dreaming of this delectable delight and can't wait to have my weekly fix. With so many flavors and reasonable prices Boba Tea House is the place to be.
