Love Oregano's. Been going to Oregano's for good 10 years. Started off in Tempe, while I was going to ASU. Wonderful food no matter what you get. I've tried pasta, pizza, salad, just sooo good. Not to mention Pizza-Cookie(forgot the spelling of real name) is to die for. I don't care what BJ's says ( they claim that their's is original and better) I think Oregano's Pizza-Cookie is the Best!

My one and only request I ask everytime I go there is to open a store in west side. I love the place, just too far... but I always try to find a reason to drive there.
