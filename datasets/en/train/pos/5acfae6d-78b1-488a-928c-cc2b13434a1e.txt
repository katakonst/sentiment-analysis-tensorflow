Don't know if it is located in a bad area of if Phoenix is depressing and crappy in general - I'm not from there so wouldn't know.
The food is great here!  What a find!  I luckily stumbled accross it on a trip cross country.  At first I thought it would be bad because there was a fat lady eating alone there.  Usually fat people eat at cheap places that serve huge quantities but that was not the case here.   I learned a lesson from this fat woman....it changed my opinion of fat people and made me less prejudiced towards them.
Way to go Thai Rama and way to go fat lady!  Kudos to both of you.
