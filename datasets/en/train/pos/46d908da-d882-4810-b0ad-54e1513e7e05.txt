Caribbean-themed restaurant with a laid-back atmosphere. We all -- Mom, Dad, big kids, little kids -- all really like this food!

Some suggestions: Coconut Shrimp, Jerk Chicken Pasta, Grilled Steak Kabobs, Ribs with Guava BBQ sauce, Calypso Shrimp Linguine, Jerk salmon w/ mashed sweet potatoes 'n plantains... Mmmm...

Save room for the homemade Key Lime Pie or Pinacolada bread pudding!
