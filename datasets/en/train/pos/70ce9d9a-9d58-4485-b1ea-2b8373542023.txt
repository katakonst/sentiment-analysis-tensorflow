Not a crafty person... but again the business name hooked me.

I have been in here a few times over the years, and all the locations seem pretty consistent - the place is absolutely gynormous, with thousands of products. Note: they have great "project-kits" for kids.

The pricing seemed pretty reasonable - excepting the framing - does anyone know why it cost less to fix your transmission than to frame a freaking picture?
