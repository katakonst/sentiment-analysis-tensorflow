This review is for the salon part of this retailer.

I've been thrilled with the services of Karen, my stylist for almost three years.  She's knowledgeable, patient, and actually listens to what her customers want.  At the same time, she's able to advise based on her profession experience and the individual's hair type.  From what I've witnessed of the other stylists, they seem to hold themselves to the same level of service.  Over the years, I've only seen a couple new faces and have come to recognize more than a few of the stylists.

If you happen to find  yourself around Metrocenter and need a cut/wash/style (starting at $35), highlights or all-over color, or eyebrow wax ($20), consider stopping in to book an appointment with Karen or any of the other wonderful stylists.
