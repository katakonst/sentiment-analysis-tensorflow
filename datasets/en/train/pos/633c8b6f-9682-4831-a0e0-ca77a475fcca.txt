i just really, really, really like their sushi. and the service. i like that they offer different daily sashimi and sushi options. we met some friends here for dinner. these friends are regulars at Sakana. they know all the service people there. and when they walk up to the chef and say "just fix us something good"....holy bejeezus....they fix something good. 

it looked like nothing i had seen before, but the presentation was amazing. and my taste buds and belly liked it more than my eyes! the regular rolls and sashimi are always so delicious and the wait staff is always outstanding!
