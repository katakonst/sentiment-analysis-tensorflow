HA ha! Gay Denny's natch! lmao! This place is awesome!!

In the daytime you can see several groups of people thinking about their would-be purchases in the near by car dealerships. But in the night time...

late night, say... 2AM-ish... this place comes to LIFE! The patrons of the nearby clubs and bars conviene here to get their late night munchies on! There's some major people watching going on!! 

Go and hang out, scope out the MUCH smaller late night menu and have fun. :)
