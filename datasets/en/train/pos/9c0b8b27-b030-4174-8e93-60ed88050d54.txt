Oh man, the most amazing mexican grocery store! The produce is cheap and incredibly fresh. Also the corn tortillas were fresh made and warm when we bought them, and delicious at dinner that night! (warning though, do refrigerate them because they go stale fast!) We had lunch there too, the tacos were fabulous. The meats are great, and they have a bar for toppings.
