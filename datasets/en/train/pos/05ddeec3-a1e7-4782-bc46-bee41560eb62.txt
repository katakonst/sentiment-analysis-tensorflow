This little place tucked just south of the main Scottsdale drag is quite a gem. I found a food tasting forum on-line which mentioned it as a noteworthy stop for some really great food. That was an understatement; from the parking lot it looks a little sketchy but never judge a book by it's cover.

Not only is this place very easy on the wallet, it's so interesting!  In addition to being a deli it is also a small Italian grocery with numerous wines, oils, cheeses, and meats.  I originally stopped in for their Philly Cheese steak and, having been to Philadelphia this past year I can honestly say this sandwich earns that name, so delicious.

If I'm ever in the area I love to take my friends and family for a bite to eat.
