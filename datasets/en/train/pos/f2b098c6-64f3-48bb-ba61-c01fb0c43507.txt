Chickennnnn! I love soul food! I was staying at a hotel in North Phoenix, but drove 20 minutes downtown to try this place!

I got the "Baby Ray" which was 3 pieces of chicken smothered with gravy and onions, and 2 waffles. Mmmmm, I'm drooling just thinking about it. I really loved the gravy, it tasted great with the chicken. The food came out fast despite how crowded it was! The service was friendly.
