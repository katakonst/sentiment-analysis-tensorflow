I think I might have a problem with going here WAY too often. I have noticed I have had to up my cardio ALLOT due to all the awesome food I have that comes from this place. I have tried everything at least 300 times, but my all time 'go to' item is the Emerald Chicken. Oh mama that is good stuff. The black beans and jerk fried rice I would eat on a daily basis. And who else gives you a cookie for ordering? I feel like it's my birthday every time I get a cookie. YUM! 

One thing, try not to use the bathroom so often, it's slightly horrific. And no mirror? Really NO mirror in a woman's bathroom? Just wrong man...so wrong.
