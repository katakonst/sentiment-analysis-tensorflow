I'm very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great! 
They don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can.
