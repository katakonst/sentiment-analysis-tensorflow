I really like this store, but that's not the only reason I'm giving it 5 stars. 

This place gets 5 stars from me because it has items I can't get anywhere else at the prices FF provides. I bought a pair of purple/black/silver falls from them in Oct. 2008. and was thrilled with the assistance and the selection. They also have fun costume accessories that are not just for the goths, gothic Lolita's and industrial crowd. 

I recently bought a really cool pair of goggles here for only $15 and some organic (bone) earrings ornately carved into the shape of an elephants head and another pair that looks like the head of a woman, each pair was only $30! 

Voted as the best place to buy a gas mask and high heels by New Times and I agree!
