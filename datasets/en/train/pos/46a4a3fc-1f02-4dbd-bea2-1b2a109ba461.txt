Yummy! 
Best before noontime when they are nice and fresh. I've tried, apple fritters(delish), buttermilk(yummy), another apple kind that had some kind of crumby coating(not crumby in a bad way), boston cream(so good), glazed(really good). I think I've had a few others but can't remember which. Not too expensive either. I did go through the drive thru at this location it does not have a list of the kinds of donuts they have. They also got my order wrong but I didn't really care what kind of donuts I got,  I just wanted donuts.
