One of the best, if not the best sushi in East Valley. Service was excellent. Family-owned business and able to answer all questions. Atmosphere and decor were high-end but comfortable, music couldn't have been better. Happy Hour menu could use some more items, however that's not why we choose to eat there. Love, love, loved Chirashi Sushi bowl. Special strawberry custard crepe dessert was amazing! Definitely adding to my favorite sushi restaurants, can't wait to go back.
