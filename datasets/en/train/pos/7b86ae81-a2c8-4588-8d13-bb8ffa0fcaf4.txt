This is one of my new fav places to eat. I'm addicted to the brisket and fries. I haven't had brisket this good since "back home" in Louisiana. While they do have homemade sauces, you don't need it! I'm not big on bbq sauce...so, I look for brisket that has enough of its own flavor to stand alone. And, the fries are so, so good. The pulled pork is really good, too. 
For those of you who know Bryan's in Cave Creek, this place is better! I really want to try breakfast one day.
