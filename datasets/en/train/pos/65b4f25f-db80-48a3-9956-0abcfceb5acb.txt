Awesome independent bookstore.  Helpful staff answer my sometimes inane questions with a smile.  Simple loyalty program costs nothing to join and adds up pretty fast.  Excellent ambiance, conveniently connected to a Wildflower Bread Company.  Also next door to Trader Joe's, so all your alternative shopping needs in one place.

Many author events and book signings.
