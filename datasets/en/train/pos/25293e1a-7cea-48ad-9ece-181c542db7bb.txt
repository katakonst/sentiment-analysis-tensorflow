I love Hob Nobs! I've been downtown for about a year now and go there often, there sandwiches and salads are delicious...  I love vito's favorite, mmmm!
They have life music, art from local artists for sale...
Everyone there is always very friendly, free wi-fi, a nice cozy setting.
Camel macchiatos are yummy as hell, go get one! I'm pretty sure they even have pizza! (Not that I would recommend combining the two!)
