This is my favorite theater.  Might have something to do with the fact that it is closest to home.  

Parking is easy, staff are quick and friendly, never a wait for concession and theaters are never very crowded. 

I like taking the kids to the Harkins summer movie program.  Great deal- 10 movies for $7 total.  Plus we always buy a t-shirt for $25 and have free popcorn all year.
