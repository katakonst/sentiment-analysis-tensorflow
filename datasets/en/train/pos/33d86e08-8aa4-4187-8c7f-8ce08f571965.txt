I'm so sad...out favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley has closed. :( We drove all the way from Goodyear to eat dinner and when we arrived we found Tott's closed with only a sign that said "closed relocating". We almost started crying as we dream about Tott's and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food.

I sure hope they open back up (maybe in Goodyear???). :)
