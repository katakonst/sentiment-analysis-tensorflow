When your a New Mexican and you find New Mexican perfection you find your heart rate subsiding and your health meter rising and brother & sister i tell you now that LDM is the most OUTSTANDING New Mexican Food Restaurant in Arizona.....period dot!!!

My go to is the pork chimi or the muchaka chimi....either way it is the finest food in the valley!  We also LOVE the Green Chili Stew and the margarita's .      

Best Mexican in Phoenix bar none!!  Any negative reviews usually come from jewish yentas that cannot stand the heat from cinnamon toothpaste let alone fresh New Mexican Green Chili.   Viva La Los Dos Molinos!!
