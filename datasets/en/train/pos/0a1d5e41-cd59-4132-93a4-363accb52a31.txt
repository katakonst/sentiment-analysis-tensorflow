Service at your seat!! =D Food and drinks!! Beer and wine!! What else could you ask for!! The VIP room's is the way to go, with the huge cushy leather couch, privacy and did I mention no inconsiderate patrons talking or eating in your ear!! Your next special occasion you got to give it a try! 

We got a sneak peek on how they prepare their flavored popcorn, I could'nt believe it was made there! Too bad there is not one in Californina I guess I need to go back out to visit the theater and have the best movie experience EVER!
