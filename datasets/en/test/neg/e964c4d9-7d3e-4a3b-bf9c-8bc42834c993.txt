Let me share my Spinato's experience with you.

I have had their pizza a few times, but the last time was the last. And I mean it. The last experience was with their food I ordered "Traditional Vegetarian", with added pepperoncini. Got home, no pepperoncini. Oh well, no big deal. Started eating it and discovered a strange flavor. Kinda like dog treats. Went to kitchen to inspect pizza. Well, low and behold, under the inch or so of cheez (I don't think its real cheese) was PEPPERONI on the "Traditional Vegetarian". UHM OK?! Verified the receipt and it was entered correctly! This household doesn't eat animals. I'm sorry, between the overly sweetened sauce, too much cheese, undercooked crust and the mixup I will never again waste my money here.

Please, if you want pizza, do not come here.
