Come on, Safeway.  You are pretty much the only game in town for downtown right now.  You would think your corporate office would recognize this and remodel and class this place up a bit.  You have people who have money to spend living all over downtown Phoenix now.  The store needs to clean up its act, improve its customer service and cater to a new demographic emerging downtown.  If I had a new better choice downtown, I would never step back in this rundown location.
