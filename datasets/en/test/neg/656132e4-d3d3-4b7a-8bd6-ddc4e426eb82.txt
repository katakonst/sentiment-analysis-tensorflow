My wife Susan and I attended an André Rieu concert on Tuesday, June 23, 2009 at the Jobing .com arena in Glendale, AZ.

The concert was well attended. André Rieu and his orchestra performed magnificently. We enjoyed the performance very much.

However, the arena's concession charged outrageous prices, including $5.00 for a little 20-ounce bottle of water! To make matters worse, we weren't permitted to leave the arena to obtain drinking water from elsewhere or for any other reason, unless we were willing to forfeit our right to see the concert! Can you believe that?
