---This is for all Subway locations.---    You bastards!!!  

Why must you make it so difficult to make a simple, crappy sandwich?   

This is how it goes, "I'd like a turkey on wheat." then they put on gloves and ask "that was a what again?"    Do they only hire "short bus" people? 

 Ingredients, yup they regularly screw that up too. Either a huge handful of onions, or peppers, enough to make you gag, or they may give you only a single piece of onion/peppers. As if to say "I don't like my job, so now I'm going to ruin your sandwich so you can have a bad day too."    

Why Subway why must you hassle me every time I get a sandwich?
