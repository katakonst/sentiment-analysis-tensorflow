I opened the door to Gordon Biersch on an afternoon recently and was met with about two dozen high school-aged children standing around, looking bored, with low music playing in the background.

I went to the bar and asked for a beer and was rudely told to leave. I stood around confusedly for a few moments, got the attention of another bartender, and was told that they weren't serving alcohol until later in the evening.

I turned around, walked down to Casey Moore's, had lunch, drank several beers, and wondered if I had hallucinated my Gordon Biersch experience.
