Slow, surly, shoddy & expensive. I can work around the first, sort of appreciate the second, and can even justify the fourth. But it's shoddy that runs through. 

I just came back with five shirts. The press-job for the top half was great, but the bottoms all had some oblong shaped, like a giant tongue depressor, neatly stamped into the pressing. Below that, the runner around the bottom of the shirt looked like a twisting DNA strand. Probably OK if these shirts were meant to be tucked in, but they aren't!

So I'm done.
