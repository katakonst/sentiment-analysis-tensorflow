Congratulations to the pharmacists at Walgreen's for competing with Michael's Crafts & Fry's Electronics for the "Worst Customer Service Award".

Not only were you un-helpful but you also took the time to discount my concerns.  I know helping me answer some questions about over-the-counter allergy medicines can be tough, but you failed with flying colors.

Your refined degree of self-loathing is a shining example to us all.  Keep up the good work!
