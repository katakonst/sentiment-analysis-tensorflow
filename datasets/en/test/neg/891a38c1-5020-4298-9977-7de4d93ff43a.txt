How is this place still open? Tried it numerous times simply for the geographical convenience. Every time the food is HORRIBLE. Last experience included gross Bloody Mary's not work the two bucks, an overcooked  and under seasoned salmon, soggy greasy fries and bad service. 

I will not come back here.
