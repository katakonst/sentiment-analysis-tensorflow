"Maybe next time".  Brak must be prophetic.  On our next visit, we got to experience the famous "warmth" that Grandma is known for.  Let's put it this way - this joint can be about as warm as Hitler's bunker during a power failure in January.  There are too many excellent breakfast options in the area that deserve our business to have to put up with such foolishness.  Sayonara, Grandma.
