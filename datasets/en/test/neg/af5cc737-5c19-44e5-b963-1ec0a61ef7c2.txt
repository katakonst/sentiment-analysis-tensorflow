So we finally ate here. The decor has not been updated since about 1967, and we were surrounded by overweight senior citizens reeking of cigarette smoke. The food was reminiscent of middle school cafeteria fare. 

The waitresses were very friendly, and the prices were not bad. We were obviously not the target demographic, though. Won't be back. Too bad, because we can walk there...
