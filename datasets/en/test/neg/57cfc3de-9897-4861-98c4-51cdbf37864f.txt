I called this office based on reviews I read here on yelp. When called I was greeted with "can you hold" I did for 25 minutes. A few times they holding call was picked up with a confused hello? They were obviously unorganized. When I finally reached someone they were very unhelpful, not giving any answers but one word. I was asking questions to clarify while they were trying to say goodbye and hang up. needless to say I will not be giving them money!
