I wanted to like this place, I really did...seeing as I am from SF, I thought - how perfect! A little slice of North Beach here in Phoenix. Not so much, as it turns out.

The meat, cheese and other toppings were great and generous, and I love the sauce they use on the sandwiches, but the bread is terrible. I am not sure if I had stale bread or what, but it was chewy and dry - I couldn't even finish my sandwich. Very disappointing, especially given the price.
