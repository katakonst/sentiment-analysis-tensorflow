I was not impressed at all.... And yes, my friends I know my fry bread. 
I had the combo... the meat was bland, the cheese was old, and the lettuce was wilted, not to mention that the bread was greasy (which it really shouldn't) and overcooked. 
I know that they're natives, as am I, maybe that was why I was expecting a little bit more "wow" since they opened a restaurant, but I left disappointed.
Nonetheless, I will not be coming back. For the price I paid I could've made better in my home, with tons more flavor.
