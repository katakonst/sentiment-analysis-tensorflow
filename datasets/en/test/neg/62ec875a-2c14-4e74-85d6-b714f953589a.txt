I hate this mall. Whoever said it was Metrocenter for the East Valley is right. 
Parking is always a nightmare, the single story let's-all-walk-in-a-circle-like-cattle layout sucks and it is screaming baby/stroller central. 

I give this mall one star only because of the Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs in the food court.
