I honestly cannot comprehend why anyone likes this place. The tiny bowl of chips they give you are almost as insulting as the tomato puree they call salsa. 
Perhaps Sonoran stands for bland? That is the only way I can describe any item on the menu. Tasteless. They keep moving locations and I keep forgetting I don't like the food no matter where they put the restaurant.
