No Bueno!!!

This place looks nothing like the photo's on the Ramada Website! The halls smelled like cigarette smoke as did all 3 rooms I looked at. It needs a total remodel. Better yet, bull doze it down and forget about it. Also, it's in an industrial area/commercial area that has a lot of closed business'. The walls are paper thin and the furnishings are old and busted. Keep going up 101 to the next exit. I do have to mention the staff was really nice! They deserve a better facility to work at!!
