I don't know what is happening to Oregano's. I don't know if it's just this location or all of them, but the service here has gone so downhill that my husband and I can't force ourselves to come back. 

During our most recent visit, my husband had his entire meal (sandwich, fries, and ketchup) dumped on his lap. I couldn't stop laughing at the time and the server was very apologetic, but it was pretty brutal. Stained shorts and everything. What was especially surprising was that after waiting another 15 minutes for a new sandwich, we were still charged full price for the meal. Really???

Oregano's, your food is still pretty decent and the lively atmosphere is great, but you won't catch us dining here anymore. We wait forever for our food, are often ignored by our servers, and now this stellar experience. No thank you.
