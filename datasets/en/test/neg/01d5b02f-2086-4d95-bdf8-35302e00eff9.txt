Negative stars! Ugh, seriously, how can anyone give this place any stars at all? I guess if you're white trash and/or an alcoholic, you'll like the experience. I've done it once and I will never ever do it again, even if someone paid me. I've heard stories of people getting limbs amputated because they got cut in the river and the NASTY condition of the water got in their system and caused an awful infection. My hubby's old coworker fell off his tube and ended up swallowing a bunch of the water and came down with some sort of flesh eating disease. There are also bodies at the bottom that have never been found after they jumped off the cliff and died. Um, yeah! Absolutely THE WORST, most revolting experience I've ever had. This place should definitely be condemned and shut down.
