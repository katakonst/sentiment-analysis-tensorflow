I give this one star ONLY because the owner of the restaurant was considerate enough to hear my rant about his incompetent workers who could not for the life of me, take down a simple one hamburger plus fries phone order. An apology for my order would have apparently been too much, instead I got a "are you sure you called this location"? Ummm... You have another location?? I've had better service at McDonalds.
