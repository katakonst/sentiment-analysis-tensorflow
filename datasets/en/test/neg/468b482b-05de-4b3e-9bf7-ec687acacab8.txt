This is probably the most aptly named gay bar in Phoenix. Link "the Rock" to Alcatraz and voila, you have this nasty little place. I don't mean this in the prison sense, as you have the liberty to go (or leave) at your whim, but I mean it in the dirty/dank sense. Never have I been to a bar at which they ridicule regulars. Most bars would consider regulars to be familiar faces; loyal sources of income. However, I've heard staff use "alkie" spitefully in reference to regulars. This gross little hell hole is a must-skip spot in the Valley GLBT scene.
