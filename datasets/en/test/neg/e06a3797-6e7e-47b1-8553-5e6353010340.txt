So it's no wonder this store is going down a quick death. These employees lack professionalism and managers who care. When the manager of the handbags is sitting down propping her feet up on another barstool "assisting" a customer, its clear they aren't in the business of Service. Please. No wonder they have no customers. Neimans - you have no competition
