i don't understand what all the hype is about this place.  been there once and thought the food was very bland...and the bottled coke was pretty much the same price that i would pay for a margaritta at  any other place.  it shouldn't be that hard to impress me at a mexican restaurant considering i usually partake in my favorite activity while watching a cheech and chong flick before i get some grub. oh well.  i would puff puff pass this place in a heartbeat.
