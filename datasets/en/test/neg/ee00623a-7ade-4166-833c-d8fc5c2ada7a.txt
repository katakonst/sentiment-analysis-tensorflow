I thought this place was the most overrated steakhouse in the Scottsdale/Phoenix. The service was mediocre, the NY Strip had no flavor, and certainly was not aged like many of the other fine steakhouses in the Valley. The side dishes again were mediocre at best. For the $100 plus dollars we spent I feel very disappointed especially considering it was one of those "special" Birthdays.
