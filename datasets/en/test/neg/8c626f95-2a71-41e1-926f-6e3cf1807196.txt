Still waiting for Crate and Barrel ONLINE to answer my question about the interior construction of a Baxter Sectional chaise. Seems no one knows anything about it.Since you are willing to risk buying it online, it would be nice to know what the interior construction is!

I've been wating for six weeks and sent several emails of inquiry. Still no reply or information. The Crate and Barrel website shows no information on this. Why should I give my money to a company that can't answer a simple question? Anwer: I'm not going to.

Hope this email can be forwarded to the Crate and Barrel upholstery buyer!
