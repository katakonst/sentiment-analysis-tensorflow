My a/c went out on 6/22/11, so we made a service call for the next morning.  The technician came while I was at work, spoke with my wife.  Technician said that there was a leak and the unit needed replaced, but he could go ahead and fill it with 3lbs of freon.  My wife told him to go ahead if it would get us through the summer, and we could start looking for someone to maybe replace the unit.  So, $367 later, the technician leaves and 6 hours later the a/c unit completely dies.  I called them back that evening when I got home from work and their response? "What do you want us to do about it?"  Why would he fill the freon and charge us if he knew it would die?  Screwed again by an a/c company in Phoenix.
