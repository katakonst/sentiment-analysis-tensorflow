Use to go here alot growing up but stopped when I ordered a huge amount of spring rolls for a work pot luck.  People were excited as they knew what spring rolls were. They cut it in half for me but when we opened it, there were tiny ants crawling out of the noodles!  I proceeded to contact the food inspection authorities and found other complaints on their website from the general public.  I can't believe I had been eating here for the last 10+ years even when they had no AC (one summer) or would sometime run out of the dish that I ordered!  I'm Vietnamese so I have gone to plenty of hole-in-the-wall restaurants and they were great and so was Da Vang until my incident and reading those other complaints.  My appetite is gone for them.
