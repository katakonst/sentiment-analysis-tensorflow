so gross.  I was expecting something on par with Pacific Seafood buffet, as it is priced the same, and has similar praise on yelp.. 
SO GROSS.  They have a dude standing around playing with sushi, making it seem fresh, when in fact it's pre-sliced, in plastic tubs, and has been sitting around since...????  I'm doing a low-carb diet, and was expecting a wide array of edible seafood, and other meats, but there really wasn't much to choose from, which meant that I ate.. carbs.. which happens sometimes.. no big deal. BUT WTF even their fried carby things were really terrible. The crab legs were cold, and tasted like a wet bathing suit that had been balled up in a bag for 3 days. Everything sucked. 
Boo, Crazy Buffet. Boo. ALSO. desserts next to raw oysters? that just struck me as odd...
