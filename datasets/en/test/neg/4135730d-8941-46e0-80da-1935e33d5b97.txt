I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time. I would never ever go back there. The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad. The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions. To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone . So rude and bad customer service. It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!!
