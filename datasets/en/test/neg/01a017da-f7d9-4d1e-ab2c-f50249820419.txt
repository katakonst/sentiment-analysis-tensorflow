Sushi Brokers is the Ra of sushi bars.  (See what I did there?)  I have been only once and was so disappointed I couldn't drag myself back.  It's one of those sushi bars that make up for a lack of quality product by masking everything with cheesy names on a menu filled with "creative" rolls.  Calling these concoctions sushi is like calling the new Burger King Ribs BBQ.  It's always packed when I pass it.  Which makes me like it even less.  This is not a place for sushi lovers but a place to appear to be a sushi lover.
