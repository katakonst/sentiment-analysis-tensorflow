Read some of the other reviews before going.  So many positives, I was really looking forward to trying this place, always hoping for a good sushi buffet, but always having been disappointed..

First, the good stuff.  Lots of variety.  Very clean.  Staff is friendly and helpful without being obsequious.  

But ultimately, it's the food one goes to a restaurant for, and in this the place fails.  Food that should have been warm wasn't.  Sushi didn't look, taste, or have the texture of fresh.  Rolls mostly tasted the same - couldn't tell one from the other.  

Desserts?  Again, lots of options, all mediocre.

Felt it was really a waste of money.  Won't be back.
