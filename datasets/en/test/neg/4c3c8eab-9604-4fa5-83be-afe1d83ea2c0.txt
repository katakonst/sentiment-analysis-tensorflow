0 Stars if I could

The new owner & management is not customer focused.  We walked in last Saturday at 9:00 am and there was not one customer in there.  We inquired about getting two pedicures, the owner/manager told us they couldn't help us because we didn't have an appointment.  They were expecting their first appointment at 10:00 am.

Needless to say we walked out and will not be returning.
