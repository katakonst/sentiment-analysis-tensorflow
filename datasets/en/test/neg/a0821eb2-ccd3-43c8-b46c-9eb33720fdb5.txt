The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...

Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...

I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)
