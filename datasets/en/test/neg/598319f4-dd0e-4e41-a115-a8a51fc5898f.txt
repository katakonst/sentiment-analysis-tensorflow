If you are even thinking of buying a computer, I've lowered it to one star.  I  just gave up on the Apple computer I bought here.  One problem after another, I finally gave up when it kept crashing every two to three minutes.  I put on the most expensive virus system possible.  Nothing helps this machine I was sold.  End result is I am junking the thing.  Buy furniture here, buy office supplies.  Buy a computer...never.
