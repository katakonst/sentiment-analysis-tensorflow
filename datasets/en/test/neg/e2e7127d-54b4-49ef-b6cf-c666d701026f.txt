When I was a kid, my dad used to fry bologna for dinner. 
I hated it. 
It was so greasy, it left a film in my mouth...as if my tongue was coated with some sort of lard.
Well if you like this sort of thing, I highly recommend going to Church's. 

I ate there last week. Afterward, one of the women in my office asked if I lost a bet.
When I pressed, asking why she'd say something like that,  she responded;

 "I noticed you had lip gloss on."
