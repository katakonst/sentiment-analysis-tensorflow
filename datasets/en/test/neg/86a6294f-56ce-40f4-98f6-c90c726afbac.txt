Worst place ever. Being from jersey I feel embarrassed for the clowns that run this place that call it "pizza." 

Here's a clue...travel to the east coast and look at the crust to make sure you know its thin and doesn't taste like cardboard. And when your sign says open till 1130 on Friday and it's 1030...try and look polite and invite your customers in by taking their order. 

All they had were 8 nasty slices of pizza made like yesterday denying to even make you a cheese pie with 1 hour left until they close. 

Welcome to America and learn to treat your customers with respect. We're the reason you have anything. Don't worry I won't be back to hassle you with making me pizza at YOUR pizza restaurant.
