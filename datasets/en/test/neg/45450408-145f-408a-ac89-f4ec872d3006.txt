Geez talk about bad service! We took some ink cartridges back to recycle them and we were treated very horribly! Whydto they call the customer service station "customer service"?? They obviously don't live up to their title. I was starting to loose it when we were skipped in line and ignored, all because an employee didn't want to bother with taking a couple boxes of used ink cartridges. Sorry Staples... Office Max will now have my business!
