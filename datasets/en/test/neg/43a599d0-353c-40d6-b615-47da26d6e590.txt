Went in today to get lunch at this place. I walked in and stood there waiting to be acknowledged...not happening. There were several employees that saw me and didn't even acknowledge me. I stood there for approximately two minutes waiting and I turned around and left. No smile, no welcome to Philly's Famous just a blank stare and a conscious avoidance. I won't be back.
