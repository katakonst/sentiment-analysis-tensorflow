Oh Good Lord Baby Jesus.  How I loath clubs like these ... nothing againts this place ... just the genre in general.

I was there REALLY early but there were so few "ladies" and the guys for the most part looked like middle aged tools desperate for a date.

Then again, perhaps a large part of it may have had something to do with the party in celebration of a calendar of Big Ten college girls in swimsuits (how novel!).

This is EXACTLY why Scottsdale is ... well ... Scottsdale.
