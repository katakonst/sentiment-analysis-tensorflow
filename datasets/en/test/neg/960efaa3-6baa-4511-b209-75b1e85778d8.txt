Worst Walmart ever!!! I drive the extra miles to go to another walmar just so I dont have to be stuck at this one! Checkers are SLOW, so the lines are SLOW. There is NEVER more than 4 lines open at once, so naturally the lines are LONG!!!! More than a few times I have gotten so irritated that I left my cart in line and left. Hate this Walmart!!!!
