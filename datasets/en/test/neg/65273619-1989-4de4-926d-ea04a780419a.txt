Today was my second time visiting. First time was okay. However, it appears that today the owner/manager was more interested in his bottom line. He missed me ordering their below average breakfast selections and less than okay coffee, so as lunch was nearing he asked that I please move to smaller table (the place was not busy). This would be fine if he had asked everyone in a similar situation, but he did not. Not to worry as I took my business up to Copper Star Coffee.
