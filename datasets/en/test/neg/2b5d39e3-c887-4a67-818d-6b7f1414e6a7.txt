OK, I know this chain is very popular but I gotta say I don't get it. The burgers are so generic and the fries look and taste like they are three days old.  I have been to several In N Out Burgers throughout Arizona and California so I know I have given them more than their fair shake at impressing me. One credit I can give them they are consistently disappointing.
