Microwave. Rubber. Chicken. 2 weeks ago I made the horrible mistake of ordering a non-steak item. Horrible, inedible "Chicken Masala" was MICROWAVED! So rubbery it went "boinnnng" when I picked it up. The taste and texture was disgusting. Chef Ramsay needs to come in here! The 5 star reviews are a LIE. The only thing going for it is the name- and paid reviewers. Foul- go there and see for yourself! Try the food. NOT GOOD- my cats wouldn't even eat the leftovers. Really gross. Maybe their steaks are good, maybe it's the ONLY thing that's good. Miserable food.
