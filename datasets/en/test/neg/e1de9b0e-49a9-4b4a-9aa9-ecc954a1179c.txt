Stopped by this KK as I was passing by to see what the "new" stores would be like and once again I was very disappointed. Im a huige fan of the hot, moist glazed donut but it was no where to be found! The donuts they had seem like day-old donuts. Forget the coffee in Krispy Kreme as it tastes like gas station coffee. Very dry anhd bland. Im a huge Dunkin coffee addict as you can tell but Krispy Kreme has really gone downhill and these stores that are re-opening I dont think will last long since everyone who goes to one all says the same thing: Donuts are not what they used to be!
