Weak.  This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe.  Gone now.  Long Wong's quality is lost on this place.  I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered.  Bad, bad, bad.  Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again.
