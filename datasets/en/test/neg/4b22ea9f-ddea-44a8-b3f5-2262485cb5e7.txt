Uh, it's definitely an eye sore. Not to mention that all the construction tape and fences make the nearly impossible to find underground parking that much more difficult. Whew. I'm just glad I survived my trip downtown, managed to locate the entrance to the parking garage and handed over $4 for an hour + of my time that I'll never get back.

And for those of you looking for visitor parking, it's at the corner of Washington and 1st Ave (not Central, as I was told). Good luck!
