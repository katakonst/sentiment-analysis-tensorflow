I have been a big fan of this mall for a while, until today.  We were shopping at the Albertsons.  While I went inside, my girlfriend and baby waited out in the car in the parking lot.  They both dozed off while they were waiting for me to return.  A mall security guard banged on the car window and woke them both up and announced "no sleeping or waiting in the car!" Are you kidding me?  A mother and child?  Then he waddled into the store to get a coffee.  Shame on him and Shame on mall management!!
