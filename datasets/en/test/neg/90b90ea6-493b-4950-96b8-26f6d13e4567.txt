The only reason I took the time to write this review is to prevent others from having a similar experience we did. We were craving some good Vietnamese food and after reading all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this restaurant, decided to give it a try. The place itself has a lot to be desired, but not even the dirty floor and a filthy door handle scared us off. After all, the other 30+ people loved the food. So was the food worth the experience? Not at all! I am still trying to figure out what is so special about the spring rolls the reviewers are raving about. This place made Pei Wei seem like top of the line Asian cuisine.
