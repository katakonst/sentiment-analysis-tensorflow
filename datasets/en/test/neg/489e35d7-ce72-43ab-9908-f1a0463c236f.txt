Went there on a Saturday night. At 11:00 PM, nobody in line, waited for 10 minutes (still first in line) and asked the bouncer what is going on and why we can't we get in. ----- you have to wait ??????!?!?!?! I'm ready to get in, have a drink and have fun, wait for what the place is half empty ????---- ohhh I know but you have to wait. ME: This is retarded I'm never coming back. The End.
