Lifetime Fitness continues to market to me via snail, email and telephone. When I express my reason for terminating my membership they respond by pitching me with their latest "we miss you" promotional offer to return. In the end Lifetime is just another nobody cares organization. Perhaps the company's CEO - insensitive self absorbed Bahram Akradi needs to climb down from the company Hawker Jet and his 7 figure salary to read a few Yelp* reviews.
