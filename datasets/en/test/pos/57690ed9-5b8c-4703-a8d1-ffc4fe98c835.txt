I've been 4 times, my sister was pregnant and the baby needed that Pho--Lucky me!

Best Pho, ever.  

Best spring rolls and the egg roll is served the right way--with lettuce to wrap around.  Also, fresh oil--not oil that's been around for 100 years--you know what i mean... *fresh*

Huge, generous portions, fresh and authentic.  Gracious and hospitable service and the prices are insanely low.

So good that I'll drive to Chandler from South Scottsdale just for a taste.

Go.  Now.

-*- After reading a couple of reviews, I have to request that anyone please *not* dine here if you can't handle Vietnamese people eating next to you--I would hate for your bigotry to ruin the experience for anyone else.  In fact, you should probably not dine anywhere outside of your home if you're so consumed with hatred for anyone of a different ethnicity.  Thanks, much appreciated!  =) -*-
