Used a Yelp Deal for the first time here. Sweet!

Every few steps on Roosevelt lead to good times, but Filmbar sets new standards for a more groovy nighttime experience. The tap selection, while small, excels in the taste factor. Pear cider? Four Peaks Peach? At $5 a pint, I can have a real good time. Wine connoisseurs will also be catered to.

The lights are low, the lounge is comfy, and the DJs are fantastic. They are heavy with the foreign house mixes, and you should be prepared to dance in a warm, intimate setting. Looks like a good place to just chill OR take a date. Oh, and it's an indie movie theater, too. Can we give it six stars for that?

Also, this is reason #200 the world is a more interesting place if you take time to view it through a Yelp monocle.
