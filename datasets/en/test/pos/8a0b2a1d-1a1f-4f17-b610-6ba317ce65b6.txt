This is the location I frequent the most often. It is conveniently located on the way to the 24 hour fitness and also on my way back home too! The staff there is very friendly and they have had some great sales recently. 

The store is always clean and there is no intimidation factor that of other health supplement stores that try to pressure you into buying stuff you don't need so they can get their commission. 

Their store brand products come in a wide variety of items and I always like to save on that! Great customer service here all the time. The parking gets tricky when you try to get in there around lunch time since there are some restaurants that get heavy traffic but there is 15 min. parking right up front of the store, good thinking!
