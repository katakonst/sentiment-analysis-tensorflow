So I have been doing a little surveying of the local sushi places and my suspicions were confirmed. This is, from my experience, the best sushi in the valley. A close second is Karma up in Flagstaff but for my money in Phoenix, Yasu is where it's at. Just to add some validation to my review, I have lived in San Francisco and the Northwest and Yasu is still my favorite. But don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself.
