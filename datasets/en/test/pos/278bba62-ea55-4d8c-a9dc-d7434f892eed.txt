I am going to go ahead and say this is really wonderful.. Okay I am usually quicker than this but just realized on my second visit that Gelato 64  has  guess what 64 flavors...duh.... Love the Pepermint Mocha very tasty..the nieve adored her mocha   and my  youngest  said peanut butter was very yummy.  They always run a neat and clean place  and were open on Labor Day!
