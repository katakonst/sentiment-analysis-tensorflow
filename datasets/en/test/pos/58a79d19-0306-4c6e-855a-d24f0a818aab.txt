Besides having insanely fabulous cookies (mmm chocolate chip chippers), my glowing review is  more about the catering part of this location.

I was back in PHX for work and basically used and abused the catering manager (Susan was her name....maybe??).  I'd call her every 5 minutes, needing something completely different, sometimes having my own packaging I'd need her to use, etc.

It got to the point where I'd call, say my name, the staff would immediately give her the phone, she'd say ok, it'll be ready in 5...and it was.  

This woman saved my life (well...more my job, but still) and my sanity.
