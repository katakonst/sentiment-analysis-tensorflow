forget what you know about fine italian dining. the dining at Giuseppe's is neither fine, expensive, or classy. it's a black and white tiled mecca of italian food, nestled comfortably in the same strip mall as a cellular reseller and a blockbuster. go anytime, and order anything. if you see a dude alone at a table getting drunk on red wine, that's the owner. the first time we went we cut him off for a parking spot outside. PARTY FOUL. it's BYOB, so make sure you stop at sprouts next door and get a bottle or five of whatever they have on sale.
