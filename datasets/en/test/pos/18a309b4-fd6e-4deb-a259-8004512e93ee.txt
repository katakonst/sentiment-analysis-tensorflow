This email serves as a public apology to all Grape Vine Karaoke Regulars:

I apologoze that a bussload of 30 somethings gals came rolling into your bar and caused all sorts of drunken havoc on your night.  It was my bachelorette party and I just really wanted to sing.  I sang, I think and I have pictures of us all singing, just no real memory of the singing.  Anyhow--- I THINK WE HAD A GREAT TIME!
