I stop here everyday, when I can. The "Matador" is the best coffee drink on the planet, it makes my coworker go in to this berzerker frenzy. Like a Mexican Cornholio. The chocolate croissant is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. There was one left the other day, and I almost slapped the shit out of this old lady for taking it before me.
