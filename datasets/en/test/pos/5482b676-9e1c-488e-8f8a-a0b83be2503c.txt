This is just about the best hole-in-the-wall I've found since moving to the Southeast Valley last fall.  It's small, with seating for about forty inside and aother fifteen outside.

Service is attentive and friendly.  Menu is written by the owner, who has been a cook since before I was born. :)  Substitutions are not a problem and, unlike most small places, they don't nickel-and-dime you for stuff like a side of ranch.  I very highly recommend this place, particularly their Spaniard omelet.
