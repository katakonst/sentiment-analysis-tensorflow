I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint! 

These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3" square) brownies you will find! 

I'm tellin' ya! TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except they're taking their own holiday break right now, so you'll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix! Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!!
