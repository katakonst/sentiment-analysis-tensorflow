i love me some blimpies. this location is especially fast, clean, and super friendly.

unfortunately, i went to get my blimpie's on (that didn't come out right) but found a really sad notice taped to the window and the doors locked. apparently the rent hasn't been paid in a while and the landlord has repossessed the place. so for now, no more blimpies. hope they get it together and open the doors again
