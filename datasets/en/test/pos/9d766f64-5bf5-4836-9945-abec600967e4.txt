Any place that makes a BLT with avocado is tops in my book because bacon and avocado might possibly be my favorite two food groups. (Yes, they are their own food group.)

Beyond that this place is super charming. I loved everything about it. From the novelty candies to the delicious dessert case to the kitschy toys to the kitchen items. I actually thought this place was initially called "La Garage" because it was such a mish-mash of cool stuff.

I imagine if I lived in Phoenix I'd be here quite often.
