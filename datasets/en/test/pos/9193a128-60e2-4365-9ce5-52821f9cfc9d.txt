Let me explain the 5 stars... I'm from southern california... all the wal-marts are gross and dirty. The associates are rude and generally aren't there to help you. You literally feel like you have to take a shower after you get out of the wal-mart. Dirty kids running everywhere with no parent in sight... 

That wasn't the case with this one. The husband and I decided to go here primarily for groceries. I was in such shock when i walked in and cashiers were there standing and smiling, asking if they could help us!  There were associates actually doing their job, instead of chit chating! The carts were moderately cleaned too! 

This was a good experience at the Wally-World. Normally I shop at the local targets, however, with this wal-mart I  might just go back!
