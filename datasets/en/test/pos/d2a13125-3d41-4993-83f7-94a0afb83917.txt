Shouts out to Carpet Medic! Dan is fantastic and pretty much came in and saved the day for carpet needing cleaning ASAP. He was helpful, professional and just plain likeable. For instance, he told me Philp would be cleaning our carpets so I wouldn't be surprised it wasn't him knock. 

Philip showed up on time and did a great job. He listened to our concerns and went far and beyond our expectations. He conquered old and newer carpets and my mom is delighted with the results.  Unfortunately, all of the stains didn't come out of the old carpet but I don't think anything would have removed those stains besides removing the carpet! 

Later that day, Dan called to check on the cleaning and ensure we were happy customers. This sealed my opinion Carpet Medic is a company I can trust and look forward to doing business with again.
