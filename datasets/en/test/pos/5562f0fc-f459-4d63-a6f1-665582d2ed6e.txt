The burgers at The Works are friggin' amazing, there is not much more to say about it.  The menu is just a budget sign (where Cheddar is spelled "Chedder", yipes...) with a variety of burgers and sides that are sure to please.  The fixins bar is also outstanding, of course I am the kind of slob who tries to put 12 slices of tomato on his burger, so take that for what it's worth.  In addition, they have Super Mario Brothers of 8-bit Nintendo fame which you can play for a quarter while you wait for your burger.  I once made it to Level 8 before my burger was ready which says a lot more about my hours wasted playing Nintendo than their service, as the burgers always come up pretty quick.  Great place, highly recommended.
