Many of the store people offered to help or at least said hello.   I needed to replace my cleats on my golf shoes but forgot my cleat wrench back home in CA  The nice salesguy offered to replace my cleats on my shoes for just the costs of the new cleats so I took him up on his offer.  The service was great and this place has a nice atmosphere for golfers.
