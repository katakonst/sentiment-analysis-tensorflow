This is a great bookstore if you are looking for a gift or even for yourself.  They have everything from religious books, top sellers, music, art, CD's.  They have a great children's section as well.

Sign up for their members reward program.  They have two of them.  One is free and the other is $25 a year.  You earn points (5 and 10% respectivly) towards merchandise.  You also get their catalog and it includes a coupon.  

I also check out their clearance section.  They have two- one for adults and one for children.  

They are always offering deals there.  If you have not been in a while I would go.  I would avoid though right before Mother's Day and Christmas.  Those are the two busiest times.
