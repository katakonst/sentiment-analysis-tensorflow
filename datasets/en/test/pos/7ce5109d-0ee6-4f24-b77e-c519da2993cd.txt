What a wonderfully relaxing experience. I got my first professional pedicure this afternoon (I'm already 26 so it was about time). Great prices, great extra leg and back massages came with the pedicure. They are very professional and kind. It was such a treat going here. I especially enjoyed the massage chair, it's better than most salon massage chairs. Highly recommend. I know I'll be back.
