Took friend for one last ride in the desert and then we popped over here for some classic vittles and suds.

We grabbed a few beeers, ordered a few burgers and listened to Skip on guitar.  It was the perfect setting for a Sunday evening and as the sun was setting on the horizon, I was reminded of many good times at this old school hangout.

Looking forward to my return visit in the spring.  Next stop, Rocky Point.
