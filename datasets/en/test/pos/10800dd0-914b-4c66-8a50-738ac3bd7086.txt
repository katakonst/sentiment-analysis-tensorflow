This was a fantastic buffet and my mom really enjoyed her birthday brunch.  We had crab legs, oysters, shrimp, caviar, lamb, prime rib, antipasti, fresh salads, smoked meats, I could go on and on (and I did)!  I ate so much I nearly had to pass up the huge dessert bar, but managed to have a few cream puffs and some cheesecake :)  Plus, kids under 5 eat free so when you consider my mom, my son, and I all ate for around $60 it was very reasonable.  

I am pretty sure we will go back for a gluttonous Easter feast on the patio.  They have fantastic views, too!
