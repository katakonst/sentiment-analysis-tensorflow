I came in here to rent some linens because the vinyl table cloths weren't going to cut it for this shindig, dahliing.  Evelyn really worked to make sure that I was getting the best deal.  Like, I wanted some skirting to go around the table but she told me how to work it so the table still looked good and I didn't have to pay for the added linens.  

Also, while I was walking around I saw this huge massive fan, I can't get it out of my head.  I can't wait to find a purpose to rent that sucker.  They also seemed to have a lot of stuff for weddings, which won't help me at all but it may help you.
