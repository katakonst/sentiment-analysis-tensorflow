I just moved to Phoenix area from So-Cal and needed to find a dentist that I was comfortable with. 
Dr. Patel is very personable and the staff very friendly and caring.
The office manager Karen was really great at working with me and making me feel like I had been coming to this office for years!
What a great place to take your family!

I highly recommend this to anyone in town or from out of town looking for the kindest top notch dentistry in the Phoenix area!
