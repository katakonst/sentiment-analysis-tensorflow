Good food, good drink selection - can't complain about that.

Then you walk into the venue, and it's all sorts of fantastic.  Bleacher seating if you wanna chill. Places to put your food and drink if you want to mill about.  The place is pretty small so if your favorite band comes through here it's a MUST that you check them out - very intimate.

Another bar towards the back is pretty accessible and the bathrooms are never a hassle.
