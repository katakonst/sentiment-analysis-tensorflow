Hate to say it, but I totally love F+E. The prices are great, there's plenty of sale stuff to keep my recipes interesting, and I like the all self-serve checkout for when I don't really want to chat over my wine + ice cream + tampon purchase (How's my day? I menstruate. It's terrible. That's how my fucking day is.). 

Um, yeah. TMI? Maybe. Just go here. It's great.
