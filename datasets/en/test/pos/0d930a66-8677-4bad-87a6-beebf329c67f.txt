First up, great coffee. It's a shame they have such tasty mochas, because here is a place you can get a solid cap or espresso without fear. Just too many decisions. Their homemade whipped cream is amazing, so I often open for the quad-shot con pana to light me up. It's fantastic.

Next up, friendly, smart staff. They always seem extra happy, which may be the constant buzz from the espresso and whipped cream rushes I am sure they cruise on all day.

Cap it off with tasty pastries, nice vibe and decor, and it is one of my favorite coffee shops in town.

The only downside at all is that it's popularity can make it crazy busy, so if you're looking to sit and relax or work for a bit, get there eeeeeeearly.
