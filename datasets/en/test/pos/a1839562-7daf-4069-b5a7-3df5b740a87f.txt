I have eaten at several different locations of Coco's. For some reason this one is always the one that serves the best food with the best service.

Having eaten a variety of foods here and never have had anything to complain about, is pretty close to a miracle. I bitch about everything.
Even the steaks are always cooked as I ask, med-rare and they are tender and have a great flavour. I just wonder why this location? I guess I am just lucky my sister made me pull in the parking lot one morning.
