ok... Emily FORCED me ... yeah that's right... FORCED me to eat the mushroom appetizer they were serving at the YELP Birthday Party.  It was actually REALLY good!  I don't eat mushrooms due to my mom forcing them down my throat while I was a kid.  I actually tasted it and ate the whole thing!  If my wife reads this or anyone else... you can call her and ask for yourself! :)
