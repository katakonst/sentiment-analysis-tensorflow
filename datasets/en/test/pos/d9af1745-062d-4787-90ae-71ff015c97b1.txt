I have yet to find a better blues, jump blues, swing, etc... venue in Phoenix.

So, on the Phoenix scale of music venues it gets 5 stars.

Yes, it's a dive. Which is a good thing.  No pretentious personalities at the Rhythm Room. Cheep beer, a decent dance floor, decent sound and great music are all that really matter.  Rhythm Room has them all.  It kinda reminds me of the Foothill (R.I.P.) in Long Beach, CA. And that's a good thing. I miss the Foothill dearly.

Also, what is possibly the best show (Mates of State), out of hundreds I've ever seen in many cities across the U.S.,  was at the Rhythm Room.
