The GF had been raving about this place for sometime now so we decided to go. I must admit, it was all she cracked it up to be. I have NEVER been to an upper high end restaurant that was so crowded you would have thought you were at a TGI Fridays. That just says one thing. The food is AWESOME along with excellent service. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to be undoubtedly satisfied when spending at least $200.00 for two!
