The only thing I miss about long commutes from the suburb I used to live in is being able to switch back and forth between NPR and Howard Stern in the mornings. Nothing sums up my life better than 17 minutes of US foreign policy toward Zimbabwe followed by 8 minutes of boobs, farts and giggling. 

My commute is barely 7 minutes now so I'll only get a tiny blurb of the news, and when the weather cools I'll start biking so I won't even have that. Thank god for podcasts.
