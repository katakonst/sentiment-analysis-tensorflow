This place does everything right. We had to wait for a table, no problem! The large outdoor patio has waitresses. You can  come for the drinks but you will stay for the food. Both meals I have had here rank among the greatest I have eaten anywhere. My wife, who has different taste than I, agrees. The dessert we ordered was amazing as well. 

It is fancy here and you are treated like it. Excellent place.
