Don't have enough words to carry on about how thrilled I am this is in AZ and how yummy yummy everything I've had here has been. If I were fluent in Vietnamese as well as English I still doubt I'd have enough to say.

So let me go for brevity: This place flippin' rocks. And they don't take American Express. Or any other card for that matter. BRING CASH.
