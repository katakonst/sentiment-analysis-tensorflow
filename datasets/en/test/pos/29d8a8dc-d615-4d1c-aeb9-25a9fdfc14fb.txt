What's the big deal?  Atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, local products and good selection.  I shop at Amazon and at Changing Hands.

I really think this is a great place.  I buy most of my gifts from here, I like to give books and local artist's stuff.  The store is a really jewel in valley because of its local flavor and its commitment to keeping Tempe smart and informed.  There are very few bookstores as good as this one in America anymore, clean, stocked and popular.

And being attached to a Wildflower is good for anybody.
