Excellent service cute clothes and kids trinkets and toys. The real reason this place ranked is that my kids were goofing off in there and the clerk/possible owner, a kind lady with a magnificent British accent who hails from Nottingham said they were very well behaved. 

When we left after buying a couple of small toys, she told both of my crumb crunchers to take another small toy they had been playing with and would not accept any money for the toys.
