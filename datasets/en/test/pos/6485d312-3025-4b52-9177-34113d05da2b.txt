Step foot inside Lenny's and you'll know what it feels like to live in 1950's USA. This is an old-fashioned burger joint at its finest, serving nothing but good old fashioned burgers. Don't ask for foie gras on your burger here. No here, you'll get a juicy patty, mayo, onions, pickles and ketchup. Here you'll eat every single calorie and never regret a single bite. That's about all I can add to the reviews of Lenny's, but if you want a delicious, juicy old-fashioned burger, visit Lenny's.
