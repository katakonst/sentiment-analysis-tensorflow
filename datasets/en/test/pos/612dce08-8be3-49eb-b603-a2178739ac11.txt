Oh yeah... The Strand is a keeper. I expected it to be good, but after I was done with the veggie pizza my eyes rolled to the back of my head and I felt like I needed a cigarette. It was that orgasmic. 

All the restaurants along 1st Street are phenomenal, and the Strand fits in nicely. Fantastic, high quality food at very reasonable prices, friendly service in a unique, urban atmosphere. And praise be to whatever deity you believe in that this place is 1) open past 5 pm AND 2) open on Sundays. 

I can't wait to go back.
