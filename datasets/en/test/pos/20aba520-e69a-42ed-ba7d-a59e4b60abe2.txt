Kierland Commons, and now Scottsdale Quarter (across Scottsdale Road) is one of those fun outdoor Malls you see mostly in California (Walnut Creek, etc), and believe it or not Chicago (Old Orchard). 

The stores are a mixture of upscale and the eclectic. You have Z Galleries, Restoration Hardware and Crate & Barrel next to the Rock Star store.  But the best thing about Kierland is the dining experience: Tommy Bahamas, Zinc Bistro, etc.

Now, you can shop till you drop and eat & drink till you... er, drop, too.
