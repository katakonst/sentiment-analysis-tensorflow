My agent really does deserve 5 stars.  Not only has she saved us money, but she calls periodically to make sure we don't have any questions and are satisfied with our coverage.

And this was a new one to me...Her office sponsored a private showing of Transformers complete with gift cards for snacks and prizes from Crate and Barrel.  The catch?  There was none.  No spiel about a new product or upping your current coverage.  Just a free movie as a thank you.  Who does that? Terrific office!
