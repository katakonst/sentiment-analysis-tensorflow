After an intense therapy session, I came to Wild Thaiger to debrief. 

They have lunch specials and bottomless french-pressed tea. The organic green tea is my favorite. Everything was very delicious and refreshing. The patio is the style of restaurants on Washington Ave, Miami Beach.

My 'Thai Spicy' green curry beef came out artistically and I took a picture. I saw other people taking pics of their food, as well. Who doesn't want to eat beauty?

The soup was fantastic. I doctored it up with mad jalapenos and dry red chili paste. My nose was snotting down my face.. 

Cultural note to the haters:
Thai people eat cockroaches as an after bar street fare. Jebus ppl! 
It's better than a bacon wrapped hot dog out the side of a utility van.
