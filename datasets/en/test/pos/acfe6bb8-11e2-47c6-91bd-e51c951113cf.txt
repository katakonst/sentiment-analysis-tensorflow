I will save an extensive review until after my wedding day, but in the meantime, I will say that Mariee is one of the most adorable shops I've every stepped foot into! It probably has something to do with the fact that it's owned by an adorable British couple who moved here from London to open this bridal shop and they stock the store with the most gorgeous wedding dresses around! Each dressing room is "themed" so one is themed around NYC, one is themed around London and one is themed around Paris. It's truly the essence of a bridal boutique and absolutely worth visiting if you're in the market for a wedding dress! 

More updates to come!
