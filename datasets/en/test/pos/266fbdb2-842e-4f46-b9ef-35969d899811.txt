I especially enjoy the dogs extra grilled so they're nice and blackened. Their french fries dipped in that cheese sauce are also a guilty pleasure. I love the place, although I haven't been in awhile I used to often. I've enjoyed the footlong and regular dogs, although the jumbo all-beef dogs are thicker and don't lend themselves to having the right consistency when charred. I'll take my non-all-beef hot dog complete with hooves and other weird animal parts, I'm sure, thanks. :)
