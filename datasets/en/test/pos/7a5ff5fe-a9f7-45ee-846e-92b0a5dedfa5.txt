FAVORITE PLACE TO STAY IN SCOTTSDALE

Well, for non-resorts, that is.  It's the best location in Old Town Scottsdale, has really nice suite-style rooms, super clean, and the lobby features a grille, a coffee/starbucks, and very modern styled.  I love Hyatt Places throughout the country, but this one rocks.

The one downside (or upside?) is, the NE side of the hotel faces 2 or 3 loud bars, and at times, plays the music super loud.  Whenever the club doors open, BOOM BOOM BOOM goes right up to your room.

(Pssssttt...I kind of like it!)
