Just got back from a little trip to Sweet Republic, and I'm just happy like a kid after the sweet treats. This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, clean and cute deco, very friendly staff, delicious ice cream and sorbet and other sweets, and even board games for you to play while enjoying the treats! 

The pineapple sorbet and Cashew Turtle ice cream are my fav, definitely have a try! Yes, they've got some very creative names on their ice cream, e.g. I Love Bacon; Salty Butter Swirl?
