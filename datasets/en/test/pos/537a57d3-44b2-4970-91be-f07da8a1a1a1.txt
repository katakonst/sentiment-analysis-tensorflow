This is the spot were I go to for my family shopping specially around Christmas time!! :) or whenever I frequent Macy's!!! The staff here is always helpful and friendly!! Also when I feel like snacking I stop by their Auntie Anne's for some Pretzel Nuggets with hot salsa cheese!! Oh soo good, but bad!! Very bad, like I said only when I feel like snacking!! Overall I love their Macy's!!!
