Great place to get your hair did!!

I have been going to David Wallace for over a year now and have been quite impressed w/his magical hands. I think his prices are very fair and he is pretty precise and "Type A" when it comes to looking like a rockstar! Plus, he's very witty and we have great conversations.

Loved the fact that he also uses sulphite-free shampoo/conditioner for post-color treated hair.

It's also a good/reassuring sign when I strike up convo's w/his other clients and they have long-standing tenure w/David - that speaks volumes, IMO.

** Text/call him w/plenty of notice - he fills quickly!
