I can't say the food was tastiest thing on the menu that night because I didn't have any, more like that exceptional Mojito from the extremely entertaining bartender that made this lady give it five stars. 

Stopped in for a pre-cocktail before dinner and didn't pay much attention to the crowd (just seemed like your run-of-the-mill insta French restaurant) and likely will go back for a Mojito next time I'm in town, yes, I know it's a French restaurant. 

Cheers!
