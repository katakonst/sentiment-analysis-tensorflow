True story-

My brother and I were talking about Tempe... He was there to visit... was waiting for some great home cooked food, right?  Well mom came home with none other than a family size bucket of KFC!  Brother said screw it!  I'm going to Pete's!  

That's the review.  Best fish and chips in AZ.
