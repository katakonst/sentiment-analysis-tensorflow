I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!  

I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!  

 Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!
