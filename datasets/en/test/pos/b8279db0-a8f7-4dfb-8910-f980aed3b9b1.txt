Fresh, delicious paletas.  The selection varies a little each day, and I love how Betty's logo on the paleta wrapper can be used as a sticker.  If I ever go somewhere exotic and/or foreign, I'd love to place a Paletas Betty sticker in a random location there.  I used a Groupon here initially because I had never tried paletas before, and now I'm hooked.  If I'm in the area I will definitely be stopping by to get my paletas fix.

So far I've tried the bananas foster, arroz con leche, mango con chile, and pina con chile, and all have been flavorful, refreshing, and satisfying.
