This is a place not to miss! We have been to all the Mexican spots in the Valley (Los Dos Molinos, TeePee, Nando's, Ajo Al's,) and this is our new favorite!

We decided to give this place a try after a few years of living here and had a great authentic experience. The huevos rancheros were amazing and my husband had the chicken tacos- which were fantastic!

Don't be scared away by what part of town it's in- it adds to the experience! Be sure to get a pastry to go, the bakery is amazing!
