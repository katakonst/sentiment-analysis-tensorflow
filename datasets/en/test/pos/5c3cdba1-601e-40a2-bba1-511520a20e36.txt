I was referred to Berning's from a friend of mine.

I took my fiancee's ring to them after I had an problem with the setting (I purchased it from another store).   Zack and Patricia gave me a few options, and told me that they would do everything they could to fix the problem, but explained that I might need to re-do the whole ring.

In the end, they were able to fix the setting, the ring never looked better and my future wife could not be happier.

If I could give them 6 stars I would.   

Great local family run business.
