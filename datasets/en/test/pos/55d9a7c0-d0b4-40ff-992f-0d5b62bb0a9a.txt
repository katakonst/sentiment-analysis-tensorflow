Absolutely love the Arizona Smashchicken. (sans onions)

Really fun burgers and the staff are well-trained to smile and say nice things to you. (If they don't, just punch them) Top it off with a great milkshake and you're arteries will never be the same. They gave me and the missus a free chocolate malt just so they could see us drink it together sharing straws.
