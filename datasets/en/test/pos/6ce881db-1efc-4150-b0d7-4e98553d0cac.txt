We were in North S-Dale last night for a poker game and lost on purpose so we could get to SR before it closed. Still great, still wish it weren't so far from me.

I got a scoop of Mojito and a scoop of the ever-popular basil-lime. They were great together, the mojito is very minty and sweet. The Basil lime will kick you in the pants. Interesting how we always think of basil as a savory taste, but works so well in this sweet treat. 

Yum. Too bad it's not in a strip mall that has more going on so they could get more business. This would be a terrific place for a little indie movie theater...
