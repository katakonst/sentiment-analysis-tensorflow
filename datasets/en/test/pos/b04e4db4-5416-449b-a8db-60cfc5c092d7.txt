Five stars for the ooey gooey butter cake alone. Even if everything else at this place sucked (fortunately, it doesn't), that cake would merit 5 stars. I woke up thinking about it this morning!

The toasted ravioli was good and the sauce for dipping had a nice bite. The wine list had some good selections at reasonable prices including Rombauer merlot for $40.

Didn't even get to try dinner yet... will I need a sixth star?
