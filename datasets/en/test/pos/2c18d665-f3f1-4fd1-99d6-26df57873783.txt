I attend here. So far, it's been a great experience. I've learned a lot and I don't expect to get a job when I graduate from here because I already know that you can't just get a job because of a school you've attended. Although, I do plan on taking my experience to opening up my own shop. 

Guys that graduate from here and are complaining about not being able to get a job, stop your b*tching. The school is for you to learn the skilled trade and to earn a certification. Not to guarantee you a job.
