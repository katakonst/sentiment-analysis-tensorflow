Q: Why did the Orange go out with a Prune?
A: Because he couldn't find a Date!

Back to business! Orange Table is a lovely breakfast/lunch place that exceeded my expectations. I tried their freshly squeezed orange juice and was blown away. It's fresh and just thinking about it brings a smile to my face. It makes me wanna jump and swirl in bunch of oranges. My friend and I tried two scrambles: Greek and Garlic Scramble. The Garlic Scramble had such a tasty sauce that I'd love to eat it daily. What really sold me was the Olive Bread. It's rich, thick, and all around tasty! It's one of the best types of bread I've tasted, and will definitely bring guests to eat here again! The atmosphere is bright, cheery, and leaves you feeling happy. =)
