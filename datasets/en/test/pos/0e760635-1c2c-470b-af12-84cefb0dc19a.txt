They have closed.  There is a sign in the window saying they haven't paid rent and on their web site they also say they are closed.  I am surprised because when I spoke with the owner a couple of months ago he said that they were running at a profit only 8 months after opening.  

We loved this place.  Hope they open nearby and soon.
