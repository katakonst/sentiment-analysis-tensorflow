We had never heard of this company before (they come from Germany) but Nascar races made it nearly impossible to rent a car in Phoenix when we went for a wedding.  We found Sixt and got a car for 4 days for $250 when Budget was $800 for the same four days.  We were skeptical, since we hadn't heard of them, so reserved a car at another place just in case.  We got to Phoenix, and the counter person was wonderful.  Checking in and out was quick and easy, the price was as quoted, the counter person (I wish I'd gotten his name!  Young man working on the afternoon of 11/8) was terrific.  We would definitely look for this company again!
