This strip mall is probably the busiest corner among the rest.  It has few of my favorite places in the same plaza,  Changing Hands, Trader Joe's, Express MiE, and Wildflower Breads.  I love Changing Hands for their book events, authors signings, amazing selection of bargain books, and other fun gift items. I wish I live a little closer...
