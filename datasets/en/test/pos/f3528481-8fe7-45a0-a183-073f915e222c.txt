After today's visit, I just promoted Chicago Gyros into the weekly lunch rotation. The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable and the dude at the counter keeps the line moving; I had the delicious Philly Cheese Steak wrapped in a gyro and topped with onions, greenpeppers and cheese (not that horid cheese whiz). Their gyros and greek salads are tasty as well.

Get there early because the place gets so crowded and tables are at a premium. It's like trying to cram 10 pounds of stuff into a 5 pound bag.
