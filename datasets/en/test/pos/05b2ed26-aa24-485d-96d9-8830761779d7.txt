I am surprised that I am giving a dry cleaner a five star rating. I have been searching for a different dry cleaner ever since moving to phoenix and  I finally found one that does things fabulously without swindling you and sodomizing you at the same time!
I dropped off my blazers and jackets this morning and asked the girl working the counter if I could possibly pick them up at the end of the day.  It was already 9:10 am and missed the cut off point, but she made an exemption. She said no problem, Now that's customer service!  I love that. :)
I highly recommend this place. 
The same day pick-up is awesome, the price is affordable and customer service is top-notch.
