What a nice little place. Casual but classy, if that makes sense. Totally delicious Shepherd's Pie...I really liked that it had green beans in it, as opposed to all other Shepherd's Pie I've had with peas (ick). I kind of wonder if the big Heritage Square events impact the ambiance, but I'd definitely go back here if I'm in the area and looking for something to do. I do wish they had their own parking... the only parking I could find was in the garage on 5th St.
