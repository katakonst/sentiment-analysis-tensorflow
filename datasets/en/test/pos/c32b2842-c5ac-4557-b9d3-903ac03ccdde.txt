This place RAWKS!   Been to many sorbet, shaved ice, frozen yogurts, gelato and ice-cream joints from LA to Chicago (not NYC yet)...this is the PLACE!  I tried the Brownie Swirl and Salted Butter Caramel ice cream and I'm in love.  The molasses cookies are delicious.  

Upon arrival I was greeted by an eyeful of beautiful frozen and baked goods.  Already a happy camper the clean and modern decor iced it as a five star vacation fer me in the AZ heat.  

The two owners were great and very friendly (five stars fer being cool).  I can't wait to finish my take home pint and head back to try another flavor.
