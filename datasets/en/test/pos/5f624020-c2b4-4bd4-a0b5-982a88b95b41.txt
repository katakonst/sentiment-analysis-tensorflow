First off, I really enjoyed the atmosphere here.  

The chef knows what he is doing.  He takes an already buttery delicious treat like popcorn and adds bacon to it, awesome.  For a main course I had the duck, medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly with the skin crispy and the inside a nice pink.  The only bad thing for me was it was a bit salty but still amazingly good.
