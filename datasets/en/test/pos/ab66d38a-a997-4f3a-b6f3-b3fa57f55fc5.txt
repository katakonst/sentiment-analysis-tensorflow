Narcisse is a beautiful place! I've been waiting so long for a champange bar in the valley! I consider myself a champagne connoisseur, so I had to go try it out! I was there on opening night as well as there new lady's night on Thursdays! I'm very impressed with the staff and service, as well as the by the glass list. I will definitly be back and will be bringing more friends! I highly recommend it!
