What I like about the Newman Center is that it's college-like and has a young adult atmosphere. They play contemporary and more modern music with their live band. I like the set up, its very intimate and left me with a very nice feeling listening to their music, being in church, and after I left. It lasts only an hour, so its just right, not too short, and not too long. 

The homily was also very entertaining and the audience was laughing. I recommend this place for young adults, families, and if you want that more modern and contemporary feel. =) For you Newman members in the UCSD and Berkeley area, its very reminiscent of that environment.
