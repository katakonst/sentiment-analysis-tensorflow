Update: Found the time to take the dog to the vet myself (instead of sending others). The office was clean, new, and well lit. Everyone was really nice. I feel confident he is getting the highest quality of care and would not hesitate to recommend this clinic to others.  

6/26/2012 :The receptionist---who answers the phones, books the appointments, and makes the reminder calls--was kind and a good listener. I found him efficient and polite. My sister reports that although our dog liked the vet, my sister found her condescending and brusque. My sister is refusing to go back there. However, since my dog liked the vet, I will just keep sending him there and have my husband take him.
