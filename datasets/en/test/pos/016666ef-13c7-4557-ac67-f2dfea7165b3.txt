I am lactose intolerant.  Well, not me so much as my stomach.  Not to be too descriptive, but I don't feel well after eating foods/drinks with dairy.  For Sweet Republic, I am willing to deal with the pain.  

Sweet Republic has fantastic Ice Cream, Ice Cream sandwiches, and more.  Since it is an individually owned and operated business, the deserts taste slightly different every time I go...and that is great.  Unlike chains, Sweet Republic is creating ice cream with unique, and sometimes, slightly changing, recipes.
