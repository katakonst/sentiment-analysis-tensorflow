Great atmosphere, good chai, yummy boba and -excellent- desserts. The walls are completely covered with graffiti/urban art, and it's worth the price of a drink just to sit and look at all of the doodles. As an added bonus, it's in the same plaza as an Asian market, several varieties of Asian restaurants and an Oregano's.

Go, drink and enjoy!
