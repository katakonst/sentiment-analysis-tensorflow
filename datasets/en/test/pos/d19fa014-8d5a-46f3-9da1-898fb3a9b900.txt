This place just oozes coolness. I've only been a handful of times, and not on the weekend, but got great service. It's super hard to find, all I can tell you is there's a smaller bank facing Camelback with an ATM on the side. It's the next business alongside the ATM, just South of the bank. It's DARK inside, which is great!

I feel like sitting here, I should be making an arms deal or selling a few thousand pills of ecstasy. But you'll probably be alright just hanging out with friends. If you're poor, this probably isn't your ticket.
