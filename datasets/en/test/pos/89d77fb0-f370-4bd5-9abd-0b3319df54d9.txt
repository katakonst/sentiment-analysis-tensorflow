Best place to go and relax with some friends. The outdoor seating is fantastic with super comfy chairs and couches. 

The waiting staff is always attentive and has rarely lapsed on refills or food. 

The selection of drinks is simply mind-blowing. They have something like 150 beers on tap. Try the Young's Berry. Superb drink! 

Food is varied and very good. The sliders are always a safe bet and the fries that come with them are delicious. Also they have a lettuce wrap that must be tried to be believed.

All in all a great place to go and hang out.

Make sure you go during happy hour, otherwise the price for the drinks adds up fairly quickly.
