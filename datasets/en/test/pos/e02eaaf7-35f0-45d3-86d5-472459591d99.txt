I like coming to this AMC on the weekends because the movies are only $5.50 before noon. It is pretty cool that we are normally the only ones in there.  Also the staff is always really nice and the theatres are really clean.  :)  

If you are ever in downtown and want to see a moving you should head over to AMC.  :)
