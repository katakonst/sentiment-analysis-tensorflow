I think I hit the 'easy button' when I went here.  Having searched at 5 previous shops (best buy, sprint) for an headphone-to-laptop adapter with no luck, I walked in here, asked for it, and was quickly escorted to a wall where the employee plucked it off the wall & offered the handy little plug to me, for a nifty little price of $3.  

Now I'm able to put a headset to use for Skype, that I was no longer using with my cell since I luv my plantronics Bluetooth paired with my Iphone.  How cool is that?  

Oh, and then he gave me a $10 coupon to use on a future visit?!  Wow, now that's customer service!  O Ya.  :-)
