Papago Park Amphitheater. This old 3,500-seat amphitheater is located in Papago Park. It was constructed in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Stone and mortar. It is located next to McDowell.

I don't sit at the top of the masonry seats in the shadows of Barnes Butte like I used to and the theater hasn't been used for over 50 years really. But when I have a moment and a guest I like to walk to the top and chat for a bit, enjoy the view of East Phoenix and Scottsdale while talking about yesterday.
