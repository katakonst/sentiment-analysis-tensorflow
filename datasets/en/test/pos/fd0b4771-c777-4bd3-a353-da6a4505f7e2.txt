I love this place everything I have tried here I like. Almost everything here is the same price about $6.50 per meal. Great place to take a family or business partners. I love the colorful personality's of the staff. The items marked as hot are hot! yeah! my favorite is the Kung Pow chicken (makes my nose run and eyes water on occasion)
