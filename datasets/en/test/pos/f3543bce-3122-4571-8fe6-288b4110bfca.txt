I was introduced to Jackson White 2 years ago when I moved my father to Arizona, and needed help getting him into the ALTCS program.

They have been great to work with, and did an excellent job with my father's case.  They have been worth every dime I've paid.  In particular, I appreciate the work that Eric MacDonald did for me, along with his team.

I also had a good experience with Adam Decker, who gave me good advice regarding a real estate matter.

Overall, it's a solid firm, and definitely a good one to consider, particularly for elder-care matters.
