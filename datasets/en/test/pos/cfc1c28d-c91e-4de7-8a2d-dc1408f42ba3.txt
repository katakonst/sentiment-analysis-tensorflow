The Green Belt makes me wish so bad that I knew how to ride a bike. I used to fall of my tricycle as a kid, but thats another story.
This place has an awesome relaxed, peaceful vibe. Great for a jog, for walking your pup, or for a picnic date. It goes on for miles, and makes for great sunrise/sunset views.  I've seen a couple creepers here & there, but nothing that would keep me from coming back.
