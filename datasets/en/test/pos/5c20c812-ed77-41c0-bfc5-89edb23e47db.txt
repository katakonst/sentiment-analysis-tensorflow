Came here for Happy Hour and it was excellent. I had flavored $5 martinis, 75-cent oysters (which were amazingly fresh), 1/2 off their meaty, lumpy crabcakes and 1/2 off a gigantic plate of calamari. They don't open until 4:00 pm and that is my only drawback - that I can't sit there all day gorging myself and getting hammered...
