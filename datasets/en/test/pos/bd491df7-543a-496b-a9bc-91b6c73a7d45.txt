Go every year, always a blast! Great people-watching, too. And you learn to beat the system when it comes to getting free tastes of beer. ;)

Also, I liked it that they were WELL-equipped with port-o-johns. There wasn't as much waiting this year as there was last year. They also have hand sanitizers inside the johns.
