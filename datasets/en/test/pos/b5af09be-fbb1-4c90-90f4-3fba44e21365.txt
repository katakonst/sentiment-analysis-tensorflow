I love good shoes and when a repair is needed, I want the best to make them look as good as new. Found Boris on YELP! and could not be happier with the outcome. Boris is a genius and an artist.

Took 2 pairs of boots to be heeled, polish and freshened, one pair of cowboy boots that are turquoise teal color, another suede BCBG boots. Boris colored matched the toes perfectly on the cowboy boots and brushed the suede to look brand new. Boris did both at a reasonable price and within a couple of days.

MAGNIFICENT! Boris gets all my business from now on! Thank you.
