Is "California Cool" a brand? I think so, and I think In-N-Out personifies it better than any store in the mall selling overpriced clothing in Euro sizes.

Fresh ingredients including never frozen beef, and fries that are made after you order them. Pretty cheap pricing. Friendly service. Spotlessly clean. A secret menu adding intrigue to the ordinary.

So, what happens if you ask for your burger Gangnam Style?
