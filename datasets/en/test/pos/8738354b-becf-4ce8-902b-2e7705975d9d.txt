My favorite pizza place in town.  In my opinion, superior to grimaldi's, bianco's, etc.  But then again, a pizzeria preference is one of the most subjective there is. 

It has a great vibe, great pizza, great italian wine selection, great appetizers( Crostini Prosciutto) and great service.  There is only one wood-fired oven, so when the place is packed it is illogical to assume the pizza will come out fast.
