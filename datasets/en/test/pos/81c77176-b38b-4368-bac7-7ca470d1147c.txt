Liqueur or Ice Cream?  What?! I don't have to decide which one to have, it comes together AND I can try any of the flavors BEFORE I buy my cup...well, ok, if you say so!  Choices included the following liqueurs-vodka, tequila, Kahlua, and Bourbon.  I went with the Chocolate Bourbon ice cream.  I loved it!  Friends of mine had one with vodka which one of them kept saying " I can't taste the vodka!"However, this is the same person, who has had two apple vodka drinks and kept saying it was just apple juice not drinks therefore, Lee's is doing something right with the vodka in the ice creams!  It's a small location yet seems to work for the area.  The staff there was friendly and helpful.  And you get a punch card, "Buy 8 scoops, get one FREE".
