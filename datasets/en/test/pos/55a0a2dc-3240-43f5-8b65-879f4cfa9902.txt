I'm sure there are a lot of lovely people who've eaten at Chino Bandido before, but some of them evidently don't know what awesome tastes like.  Because it tastes like Chino Bandido.  First off, turns out anything in a quesadilla is better than anything outside of a quesadilla.  Spicy stuff, sweet stuff, it doesn't matter.  It's better with cheese.  Second, black refried beans.  Are you kidding me?  And third, why aren't I eating jerk fried rice right now?  Sob.  

If you're on a diet, stop right now.  Head over to Chino and get your grub on.
