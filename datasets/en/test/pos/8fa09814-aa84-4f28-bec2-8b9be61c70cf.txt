Now, this is a Walgreens (and I've been too quite a few in my life)!  

Sure it's in the ghetto, but they have excellent sales (I got a pack of Newcastle for an unheard of $6.99).  Then, in addition to giving me superb service, the young guy at the cashier gave me a $5 coupon on top of my overall purchase.  

It's true- first impression are important.... and this Walgreen's is doin' it right!  I'm putting a big stamp of approval on it!
