The best pizza place in Phoenix. The serious slice is the best deal around and the pizza taste amazing. I have never tried Joe's sauce (forever whatever reason I don't know why), but I am told it only makes the pizza better. I have been going to Jimmy and Joe's for 6 years. Whenever I try a new pizza joint, I always compare it to Jimmy and Joe's and its never a competition. JJP always wins!
