Finally! My baby can get the right (hand washed!) bath without me having to do it.

This place is great. It is located just North of the 101 at Scottsdale Rd. It is in a beautifully peaceful location in a high-end strip mall/business center and straight across from miles of desert. My car looks great when they are through. The wait is longer than you would expect but well worth it. 

The time really goes by fast though. Every time I leave there,  I feel like I just got out of a spa too. There is plenty to do too (if you want). Walk to the local - fantastic - stores or just sit and meditate and stare across at the miles of dessert. Go there around dusk and watch the sun set. It is fabulous!
