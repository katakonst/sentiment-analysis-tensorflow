I've been on a mexican food kick lately. And after eating at Rivas my mexican craving has been satisfied. I had the california burrito (deep fried), the rolled tacos, and the supreme nachos. [I'm fat] They were ALL fantastic! And they have a drive-thru for when I don't want to change out of my pajamas! :)
