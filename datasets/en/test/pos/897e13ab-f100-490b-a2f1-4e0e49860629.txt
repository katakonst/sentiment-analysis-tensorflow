$7 + tip... such a deal!

We realized that Jared needed his shoes shined today when we landed back in Phoenix and I had a feeling it would be cheaper and faster to get them done at the airport than at the hotel or anywhere else for that matter...

We were in terminal 4 and found Teri working for the Goodfellows location near the Starbucks - D gate.  She was super friendly and in approximately 10 minutes, she made Jared's shoes look as good as new!  
This company is based in Vegas but recently opened locations here at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport as well as multiple resorts in town.  

They say the first thing people look at is your shoes, so Jared should be feeling dynamite tonight in his... and hopefully mine won't be too shabby either :)
