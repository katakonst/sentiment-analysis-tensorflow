While I've never actually eaten a full meal at CPH, this is probably my favorite place for drinks and apps.  I don't even care that their happy hour discounts are not that great.

First off, they make a version of a sloe gin fizz.  Based on that alone, I'm at 5 stars.  The fact that it was fantastic was just an added bonus.  Second, they ingeniously thought to put bacon fat in the popcorn.  Now we're at 10 stars.    Third, 'kilt lifter" fondue.  Need I say more?
