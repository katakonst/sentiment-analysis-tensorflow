I found Bosa after an amazing meal at Becketts Table. I know, what the hell am I doing going across the street after a huge meal. Well, with experiences at great donut places in Texas, I have always wondered where the great donut place is for AZ.

Bosa Donuts is that place! They carry all the classic donuts and you won't be let down. These are not like the large chain donut places. Bosa donuts are always fresh, whether you are there at 6:00am or Midnight. Yes, I know. 

Bosa Donuts is THE Donut Place in PHX!
