Stopped in with some friends after a hike around South Mountain. We came in for a nice breakfast/lunch on a Sunday, around noon.

I ordered the Chilaquiles based on Mary Rose Wilcox's suggestion (I love chilaquiles and have had too many experiences with lackluster versions to not ask). My co-eaters ordered a plate of flautas, chiles rellenos, huevos rancheros, and a bean and cheese burrito.

The food came out fast (the restaurant was nearly empty) and it was excellent! The flour tortilla was thick and light and delicious. The chilaquiles were a little different from what I expected, but they were still quite delicious. The beans were excellent (Mexican restaurants must have fabulous beans, it's the litmus test).

The whole experience was lovely. In fact, the only minus I have of the whole experience was a series of typos on the menu. But hey, the food was delicious!
