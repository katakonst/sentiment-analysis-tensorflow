This has quickly become one of my favorite spots. I have now eaten here for all meals and have never had a bad experience. My new favorite is the tuna salad. Normally this is not my usual salad choice since most places load on the mayo and make your Innocent salad as unhealthy as a big mac but that is not the case at SOMA. Would you believe, my current salad fixation is a measly 168 calories!!!!!!!!! I AM SERIOUS! You have to try it! I am sure I will be back again this week!
