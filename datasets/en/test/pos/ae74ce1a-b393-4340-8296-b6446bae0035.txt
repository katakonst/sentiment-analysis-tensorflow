My boyfriend and I go to this theater all the time! I've even taken my son here on numerous occasions and am ALWAYS satisfied! Even if people talk during the movie, you can say something to the attendant at the front (if they haven't offered it already) and they will give you free tickets for next time. Very satisfied! :)
