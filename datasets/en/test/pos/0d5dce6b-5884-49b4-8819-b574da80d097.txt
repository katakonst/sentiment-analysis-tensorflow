I'm so in love with this place :) I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED. i love that they have a fresh herb/vegetable garden in the front.  It's all about the FRESH ingredients these days.  I can't wait to go back and try different dishes. I'd like to try the cheese platters :) mouth watering as we speak.  going again to day so I'll keep adding to this review. STAY TUNED! BTW, the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area.
