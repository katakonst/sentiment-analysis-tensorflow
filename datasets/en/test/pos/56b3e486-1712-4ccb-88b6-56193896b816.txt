I'm sitting here thinking about all the wonderful things that Jan and Helen make at Sweet Republic. They both work so hard to make sure that everyone who visits has a great experience at their store.. the last time I visited I had a frozen yogurt (gotta watch my bearish figure) and it was the smoothest, creamiest and tastiest frozen yogurt Ive had. Even after visiting Pinkberry a few weeks back I realized just how much better their product is. I know that when they make any of their tasty creations its honest to goodness.
