Caught Louis CK here last night... 

Beautiful theater... absolutely stunning. It was clean, the staff was really nice, and parking was a breeze. The sound was great, the seats were comfy, and I can't really find anything to complain about. Truly one of the most gorgeous theaters I've seen - down to every detail - it's my new favorite... I love it. 

L.O.V.E.

If you twisted my arm and forced me to complain - well, in the lobby where they were serving drinks, the line got a little excessive. It wasn't so bad really - but I tried both of the wine they were selling and I kinda hated them. This is more of a bit of advice for you to booze it up before you get there than it is a complaint. I can't recommend this place enough.
