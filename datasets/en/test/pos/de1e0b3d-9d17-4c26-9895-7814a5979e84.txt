This is one of those situations where I almost don't want to tell you how good Duane is for purely selfish reasons....

Had a big list of things that needed to be done, faucet installs, minor electrical work, vanity install, painting, and too many other things to list.  Looked on Yelp (as always) to see if I could find a handyman with good reviews and Diamond D Handyman pops up.  Called immediately and asked for an estimate - the incredibly fair and detailed estimate was provided quickly so I booked a few days of his time.

WOW, this guy is good.  Professional and reliable, you're not going to see anything half done or sloppy, no gotchas, no cut corners, no worries at all.  I've already started making my after Christmas fix it list and will be calling Duane again.
