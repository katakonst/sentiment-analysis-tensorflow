I do not care for samll thin burgers or thin frys, but I love Freddys. 

The #1 combo is great. Double burger with cheese mustard and pickles and onion frys and a drink. (Mt Dew)

The people there are cool, the place was clean, and the food was good. 

Custard is 10x better the yogurt or ice cream. It is also worse for you...muah.
