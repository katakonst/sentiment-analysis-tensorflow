This is my favorite restaurant. The chips and salsa are great and so are the margaritas. The staff is unmatched. If your bowl of chips look even half empty, you can bet there will be a spinning bowl of fresh chips on the table before you even know it. I always order the Baja Spinach & Feta Cheese Chimi, and so should you. They also (somehow) know when you're celebrating. So when you're handed two pink shots you didn't order called Mexican Koo-laid, don't be scarred. Just suck it down and order another margarita.
