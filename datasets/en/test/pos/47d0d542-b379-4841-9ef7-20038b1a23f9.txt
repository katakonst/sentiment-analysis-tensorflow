Ok, I probably shouldn't do it, but I have to put in a review for this place.  Now, the last time I was here was back in 2001, but damn, Yelp wasn't around, and I just have to Yelp a place unique like this (besides, one of my Yelp Friends just Yelped this place and jogged my memories about this Native goodness).  

So yeah, if you're in between pow wows and have a fix for some fry bread, this is the place to go.  I remember having some fry bread here and it tasted excellent.  I also remember totally loving the soups/stews as well.  There are not that many Native restaurants around, so give this one some props!

Shiiiiiiiiiiiiii.  I think I need to plan a trip to Phoenix this very minute, innit?!  

Aieee!!!!
