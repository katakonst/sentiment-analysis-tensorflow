This place kicks ass, It has everything here! Seriously....Oil changes, tire service. A gardening dept. that compairs with Lowes and Home Depot. There also is a Mc Donalds and a Bank inside. 
This Walmart is the Super/Mega marketplace one, Fresh produce, groceries and other misc. marketplace stuff. 
All the other WalMart goodies are here to such as clothing, shoes, sporting goods, home/bath supplies, toys, luggage, patio furniture, etc. You can spend all day in this place, I wish one of these was in this area I would be there all the time.
