Love this theater. Plan on getting there a little earlier, as sometimes parking can be tricky. Purchase a refill cup once a year, and get $1.50 refills all year long. Also when the lines are long to get tickets, step up to the little machines and do your own thing, it's fast and painless.

Keep up the good work Harkins. I am loyal to you thanks to your clean theaters and refill cups and popcorn. It's considerate and appreciated.
