I really enjoyed this place! I tried their iced latte which was very yummy. My sister got the iced chai latte which was also good. It reminds me of a hipster coffee shop in Los Angeles, CA called Intelligentsia. I love the fact that they have coffee and beer- pretty cool. I'll definitely be coming back here and introducing the place to my friends.
