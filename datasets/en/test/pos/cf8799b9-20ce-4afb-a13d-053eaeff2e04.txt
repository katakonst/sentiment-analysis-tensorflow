I love this place because they entice you by giving you free samples, so you would be tempted to buy some.

My mom and I popped in here yesterday to purchase some "sugar free" chocolates, and I was majorly impressed by the customer service. The lady that works there was super courteous, and even asked us if we work for a company that provide employee discount program. Luckily I do! I saved almost $12.00 with my discounts.  I am so grateful for the big savings!  I loved it.
 
 Keep up the fantastic work and the product you have there!
