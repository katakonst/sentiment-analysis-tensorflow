I absolutely love Mexican food and Salsa Blanca got everything PERFECT! Their rice and beans are so good. They have great enchilada sauce and the cheese they use is really yummy. I LOVE the hard shell shredded beef tacos. They make their own shells and the beef is really tasty. I have never found even one piece of fat in my tacos which is a deal breaker for me. The desert pear margarita is really refreshing and hits the spot every time. I could eat here everyday. I just can't get enough of Salsa Blanca!

Great quality!!!
