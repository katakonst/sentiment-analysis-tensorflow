I got a rock chip in my windshield and knew my AAA insurance would sent me to Safelite. So mid-morning in the middle of a week, I dropped in at this location. 

The receptionist is fast and friendly. She had a tech check the damage and confirm it could be fixed. Before I realized he had even seen my car, he was in the lobby explaining the damage, the fix, and the guarantee. 

I called the insurance company, got the ok, and within five minutes they were fixing the chip. My wait was short and not unpleasant. The waiting room was clean and comfortable; it's a better place to wait than my doctor offers. 

The fix was done well. I would definitely recommend this location, and I'll come back.
