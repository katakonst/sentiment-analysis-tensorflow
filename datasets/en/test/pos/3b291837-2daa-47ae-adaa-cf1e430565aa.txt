One of the better places I've found for Mexican in the Valley. Now there are a few more I need to try, but for now Jalapeno Inferno is at the top of my list.

We went to Jalapeno during the Dining Out for Life Event (hats off to them for participating) and it was very busy. Maybe it's because of their location, I'm hoping it was because of Dining Out for Life.

The food (sorry, can't remember what we had) was prepared to perfection, not overly greasy like some places and the margarita I had tasted great. Maybe the margaritas are why I can't remember what I ate?
