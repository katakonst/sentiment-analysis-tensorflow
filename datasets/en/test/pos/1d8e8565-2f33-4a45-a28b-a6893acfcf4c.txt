My experience here was absolutely amazing.  My boyfriend and I had reservations for 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and the service was amazing and the food was spectacular.  It was extremely pricey but oh my god, was it worth it.  My bf and I have both lived in Baltimore, MD for the last 7 years so we are extremely picky and spoiled when it comes to seafood .... Salt Cellar completely changed my mind that you can't find good seafood in AZ.  

Only recommendation?  Make sure you have reservations because the seating area is tiny.
