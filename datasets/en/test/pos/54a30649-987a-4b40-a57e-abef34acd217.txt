Outstanding, authentic Columbian food. Rotisserie cooked, marinated chicken falls right off the bone. Don't expect Mexican rice with your beans-- just sticky white rice, the best kind to eat with beans. The owner says everything is made from scratch and I believe it. My hands still smell like mesquite. Chuy's is in trouble!
