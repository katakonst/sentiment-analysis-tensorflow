This place is awesome.  It's at a great location and easy to get to.  From the moment we walk in, we are greeted with a smile and a great attitude.  We've been here twice and each time has been great.  They serve thin crust pizza.  Try the Capicola.  They also brew their own beer plus they offer guest taps, which they change up ever so often.  Everyone is friendly and we love this place.
