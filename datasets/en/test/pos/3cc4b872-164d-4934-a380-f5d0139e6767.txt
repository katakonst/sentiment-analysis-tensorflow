Jim the Barber did a great job on Jim the Yelper's hair yesterday.  Cut it exactly as Jim the Yelper requested.  Oddly, Jim the Yelper often doesn't get the cut Jim the Yelper asks for at other places.  That's why Jim the Yelper is going to see Jim the Barber from now on.

A nice bonus - between the big plasma TV and the baseball talk it seemed like my haircut was done in 5 minutes!  This is an old school barber guys...we're talkin' hot foam and straight razors.  The real deal.

Cash only so bring it.  Standard men's cut $14.
