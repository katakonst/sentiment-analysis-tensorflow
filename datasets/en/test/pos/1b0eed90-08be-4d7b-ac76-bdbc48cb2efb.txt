Oh my god how can anyone live in north Scottsdale and miss this gem for so long!?!
Everything is fresh, the combinations are quirky, and work amazingly, plus the service is excellent.  The owners were there when I was, and were quick to help a n00b decide.  Everything we had was great.  They were sampling orange-white chocolate cookies as well, which were dangerously delicious.  Order the whole sandwich, you will eat it all.  I look forward to exploring this menu further in the not too distant future.
