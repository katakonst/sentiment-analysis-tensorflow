......and still, the best sushi I've ever had AND they always have cute  friendly waitresses taking care of business.  Desiree has spectacular eyes and a warm smile!

Lunch today was deelish and I'll be going back a few more times before heading back to the bay.  New partner in crime will try it this weekend and I'm sure she gonna rike it.

Arigato guey!!
