$2 MIMOSAS!! $2 MIMOSAS!! 

EXCELLENT SERVICE. Our group was seated a minute after we got there (we had 5 in our group) and we sat outside. Beautiful Saturday to have brunch.

The menu selection was excellent. I had the Steak & Eggs Benedict- and it was PERFECT. And the potatoes that came with it were delicious! 


PS. $2 MIMOSAS!!!
