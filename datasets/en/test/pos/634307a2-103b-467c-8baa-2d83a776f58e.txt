I found this place off of Hotels.com.

This is probably the best place to stay if you're looking for value in Scottsdale.  We got a 1 bedroom, living room, kitchen, full bath, laundry closet, etc. for only $95 a night...  Pretty much a condo for less than $100 bucks/night.  This is a crazy value for the Scottsdale area.

The rooms were clean - room service was timely and everything looked great when we returned.  No complaints on service - they were very friendly.

I can't say anything bad about this place!
